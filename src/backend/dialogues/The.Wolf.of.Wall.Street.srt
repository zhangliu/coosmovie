00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,080
日你妈
You motherfucker,

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,180
要是44你什么也捞不到
you can't get any at 44...

160
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,560
-快他妈打电话去  -抱歉
- Pick up the cocksucking phone! - Sorry...

161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
你真是个臭傻逼  汉纳
You are such a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

162
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,320
我们才不管什么技术
We don't give two shits about how technology works

163
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,030
我们只关心他妈怎么能赚钱
because all we care about is getting fucking rich.

164
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,410
-定了  2000  -乔丹·贝尔福
- Solid, 2,000. - Jordan Belfort.

165
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,910
成功了
Done!

166
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,620
该抬价了[以不正当手段哄抬股价]
Time to paint the tape.

167
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,960
微软  2000股  上钩了
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,330
过来
Come on.

169
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,090
直播  拿着  小心烫手
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

170
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,090
放进去  把那玩意关上  关上关上
In. In. Shut that motherfucker. Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

171
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,300
成交了
Sold!

172
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,000
可卡因来点
Tootski?

173
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,500
不用了  谢谢
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

174
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,370
汉纳先生
Mr. Hanna,

175
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,170
这么美好的午后  您要来点什么
what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,960
赫克托  我告诉你怎么玩
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

177
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,510
给我们上两杯马丁尼
You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis.

178
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,130
你知道我的口味  要纯的
You know how I like them. Straight up.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,840
整7分半后
And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,

180
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,260
再上两杯
you're gonna bring us two more.

181
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,640
然后每5隔分钟上两杯
Then two more after that every five minutes

182
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,930
直到我俩喝倒一个为止
until one of us passes the fuck out.

183
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,650
这想法不错  先生
Excellent strategy, sir.

184
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,560
我现在喝水就好
I'm good with water for now.

185
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,980
谢谢
Thank you.

186
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
他今天刚来华尔街工作
It's his first day on Wall Street.

187
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
他会习惯的
Give him time.

188
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,740
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

189
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,780
汉纳先生
Mr. Hanna?

190
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,290
你白天嗑了药
You're able to do drugs during the day

191
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,160
还能正常工作吗
and then still function, still do your job?

192
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,080
不然你以为怎么正常工作
How the fuck else would you do this job?

193
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,330
就凭可卡因和妓女了  哥们
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

194
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,840
是
Right.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,520
我想说
Well, I got to say,

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,630
能加入你们我真的很高兴
I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean...

197
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,590
你们的客户实在是...
The clients you have are absolutely...

198
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,140
去他妈的客户
Fuck the clients.

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,970
你唯一的职责就是引他们上钩
Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.

200
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,310
你有女朋友吗
You got a girlfriend?

201
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,940
我结婚了
I'm married. I have a wife.

202
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,100
我妻子叫泰瑞莎  理发的
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

203
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,480
-恭喜  -谢谢
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

204
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,900
多想想泰瑞莎
Think about Teresa.

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,150
你要干的就是
Name of the game.

206
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,070
把你客户兜里的钱揣到你兜里
Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
是
Right.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,990
但如果同时能帮客户赚钱
But if you make your clients money at the same time,

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,330
不是互惠互利吗
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

210
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
不
No.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
华尔街第一要义
Number one rule of Wall Street.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
没有人
Nobody...

213
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,640
不管你是沃伦·巴菲特也好
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett

214
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,590
吉米·巴菲特也好
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

215
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,010
没人知道股票是涨是跌
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down,

216
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,300
是持平还是兜圈子
sideways, or in fucking circles.

217
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
股票经纪人更不知道  懂吗
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

218
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,050
都是掩的  你知道什么叫掩吧
It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?

219
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,510
"赝"吗  就是假的
Fugayzie. It's a fake.

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,020
什么掩啊赝啊  嫖啊飘啊的
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

221
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,440
都是虚无缥缈的  根本不存在
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,310
看不见摸不着
It's never landed. It is no matter.

223
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,940
元素周期表上找不到
It's not on the elemental chart.

224
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
根本都他妈是假的
It's not fucking real.

225
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,940
-对不  -对
- Right? - Right.

226
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,740
继续听我讲
Stay with me.

227
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,110
我们屁都不创造  什么都不建
We don't create shit. We don't build anything.

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,370
的确
No.

229
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,290
所以假设你有个客户花8块买了一股
So if you got a client who bought stock at eight

230
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,790
现在涨到16了  他乐开花了
and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy.

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,300
就想兑现清算
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,960
拿上钱打包走人
take his fucking money and run home.

233
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
-这可不行  -好的
- You don't let him do that. - Okay.

234
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,960
-因为那样就成真钱了  -是
- 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.

235
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,300
那该做什么
No. What do you do?

236
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,340
你得继续给他出金点子
You get another brilliant idea.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,880
额外的想法
A special idea.

238
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,070
制造另一种"情况"
Another "situation."

239
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,550
让他拿收益再投一支股票  不断投
Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some.

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,890
他每次也一定会投
And he will, every single time.

241
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,060
因为他们全都他妈是瘾君子
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

242
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,890
你就一直这么干
And you just keep doing this,

243
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,230
延绵不断  无休无止
again and again and again.

244
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,980
他这时觉得自己要成土豪了
Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,

245
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,150
理论上他的确赚了
which he is, on paper.

246
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,900
但我们这些经纪人
But you and me, the brokers,

247
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,320
从中收的佣金
we're taking home cold hard cash

248
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,110
可都是实打实的现金  学着没
via commission, motherfucker.

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,910
是
Right.

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,630
这太神奇了  老板
That's incredible, sir.

251
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,580
我都激动的无以言表了
I can't tell you how excited I am.

252
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,120
你就该兴奋
You should be.

253
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,960
做经纪人这行的成功要素有两点
There's two keys to success in the broker business.

254
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,630
首先
First of all...

255
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,670
-你得淡定  -是
- You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.

256
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
你平时撸吗
Do you jerk off?

257
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,010
撸...撸吗
Do I... Do I jerk off?

258
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,310
撸  撸啊  我当然撸
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

259
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,680
每周几次
How many times a week?

260
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,350
三四次吧
Like three or four.

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,580
三四次  有时五次
Three or four times, maybe five.

262
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,730
你得多撸啊
Gotta pump those numbers up.

263
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,310
干这行  你这次数太菜鸟了
Those are rookie numbers in this racket.

264
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,070
我本人吧  每天至少两发
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

265
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,480
早晨健身之后来一发
Once in the morning right after I work out,

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,410
午饭后再来一发
then once right after lunch.

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
真的吗
Really?

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,870
我喜欢撸  但我撸不是因为喜欢
I want to. That's not why I do it.

269
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,080
全他妈是被逼的
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

270
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,660
你想想  你是跟数字打交道的
Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.

271
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,710
整天都是什么小数点啊  高频交易啊
All day long, decimal points, high frequencies.

272
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,130
全他妈是数
Fucking digits.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,630
每天重任在肩  喘不过气啊
All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

274
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,970
对吧
All right?

275
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,550
太让人抓狂了  是吧
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

276
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,760
所以就得多撸  保持血液流通顺畅
You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.

277
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
私底下控制住节奏
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

278
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,850
懂了
Done.

279
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,600
我这可不是提醒你  我给你开处方呢
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

280
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,850
相信我
Trust me.

281
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,440
你不这么干  就没法平衡了
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

282
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,650
差额搞不清楚你就载了
split your differential and tip the fuck over.

283
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,030
还有更糟的
Or worse yet,

284
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,320
我亲眼见过  猝死
I've seen this happen, implode.

285
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,860
别介  我可不想猝死  老板
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

286
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,120
当然  没人想
No. No, you don't.

287
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,450
我干这行看得很长远的
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

288
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,120
-猝死可不是什么好事  -是
- Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.

289
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,370
所以有空就去洗手间来一发
Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can.

290
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,450
等你撸顺手了
When you get really good at it,

291
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,580
一边撸着
you'll fucking be stroking it

292
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,670
一边脑子里想的都是钱
and you'll be thinking about money.

293
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,840
干这行成功要素之二
Second key to success in this racket

294
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,170
就是这瓶子里的宝贝
is this little baby right here.

295
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,630
叫可卡因
It's called cocaine.

296
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,010
是
Right.

297
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,940
能让你耳聪目明
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

298
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,930
还能让你拨号指速如飞
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

299
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,390
你猜怎么着
And guess what?

300
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,020
你拨号快了  我就赚了
That's good for me.

301
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,020
好了  先生
Yes, sir.

302
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,270
周转不息  明白吗
Revolutions. You follow?

303
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,440
周转不息
Revolutions.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,770
让客户坐上摩天轮
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

305
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
我们就开赚
And it goes.

306
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,400
游乐园365天全天候给他开着
The park is open 24/7, 365,

307
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
十年如一日  百年也他妈这样
every decade, every goddamn century.

308
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,910
就这么回事
That's it.

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,540
她是你的嫡表妹吗  还是...
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

606
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,880
对  不是  她是...

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,920
她爸
Her... Her father

608
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,670
是我妈的弟弟
is the brother of my mom.

609
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,380
不是那样的
It's not like, what... You know.

610
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,010
我们一起长大
Look, we grew up together.

611
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,470
她出落得很性感  真他妈性感
And she grew up hot, you know. She fucking grew up hot.

612
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,300
我朋友都想上她
And all my friends were trying to fuck her, you know.

613
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,270
我可不会让别人
And I'm not gonna let someone...

614
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,930
让这些傻逼上我表妹
You know, one of these assholes fuck my cousin,

615
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,480
我就用表哥的身份接近她
so, you know, I used the cousin thing as like an in with her.

616
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,060
我可不会让别人上我表妹
I'm not gonna let someone else fuck my cousin.

617
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,820
要有人上我表妹
You know, if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

618
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,780
那也得是我  出于尊重
it's gonna be me, out of respect. You know?

619
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,990
我明白
No, I get it. Yeah.

620
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,240
你不怕生孩子出事吗
I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right?

621
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,530
-什么  跟她生孩子吗  -是的
- What? Having kids with her? - Yeah.

622
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
不怕  我们有两个孩子了
No. We have two kids.

623
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,370
他们...
And they're... I mean...

624
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,040
这不是人身攻击  不过他们没事吗
I don't want to get personal, but they're okay?

625
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,250
没有  他们不是弱智之类的
No, they're not retarded or anything like that.

626
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,250
但很有可能吧...
But there's a big chance, right, if...

627
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,670
是啊  大概60%
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

628
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,260
60%到65%的机会孩子会是弱智
60% to 65% chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

629
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,420
我他妈吓尿了  老兄
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

630
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,840
不管操的是不是表妹
Look, man, a lot of having a kid, or whatever, takes risk,

631
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,680
生孩子都有风险
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

632
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,510
如果你的孩子真是弱智怎么办
What if something like that happened?

633
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,180
基本上  孩子要真是弱智
Basically, you know, if the kid was retarded,

634
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,560
我就开车到荒郊野外
I would, you know, drive it up to the country

635
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,310
打开车门然后说
and just, like, you know, open the door and say,

636
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,610
"你自由了"  "自由奔跑吧"之类的
"You're free now." You know, like, "Run free."

637
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,190
你懂的吧
You know?

638
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,950
你他妈逗我玩呢
You're completely fucking with me.

639
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
那太可怕了  你才不会...
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

640
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,620
你的样子好像...不会
You look like you've... No.

641
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,540
我们会带孩子去特殊机构什么的
We would take it to, like, an institution or somewhere

642
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,420
或是专门负责抚养孩子的地方
that's handled to, like, you know, raise the kid or whatever.

643
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,040
如果你很开心  那上帝保佑你
You know what? If you're happy, God bless you, buddy.

644
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:51,860

No, I'm not fucking happy. No one who's married is fucking happy.

645
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,460
谁他妈结婚了还会开心啊
No one who's married is fucking happy.

646

Donnie and I were going out on our own.

683
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,950
首先我们需要的就是经纪人
And the first thing we needed was brokers.

684

有销售经验的人
Guys with sales experience.

685
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,950
所以我招募了几个老乡

But he didn't go along with us.

694
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,810
他卖安眠酮已经赚飞了
He was already making so much money selling Quaaludes,

695
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,640

听见没  比你们想象的还容易
You listening? It's easier than you think.

709
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,210
每个接你电话的人
Every person you're on the phone with,

710
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,800
都做着一夜暴富的梦
they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly.

711
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,050
都想空手套白狼
They all want something for nothing.

712
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,000
我有次
There was this one time

713
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,590

但嘴唇上不留胡子的
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

717
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,140
他就说他这辈子只想做家具
Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture.

718
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,980
-没懂你意思  -这和我们说的有什么关系
- I don't understand. - What's that got to do with anything?

719
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,940
你他妈扯哪儿去了
What the fuck are you talking about?

720
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,900
不是我逼你说什么
I'm not putting words in your mouth or nothing,

721
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,150
但你刚说每人都想一夜暴富
but you just said that everybody wants to get rich.

722
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,660
我操  你刚确实说了

724
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
对啊  佛教徒也是  他们才不在乎钱
Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money.

725
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,330
他们只穿僧袍  也没什么花销
They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit.

726
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,160
我又不是说佛教徒或门诺教徒
I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish.

727
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,000
我是说普通人  工薪阶级  平凡群众
I'm talking about normal people, working-class, everyday people.

728
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,000
人人都想赚大钱  我说错了吗
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

729
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,380
那种超凡脱俗的人根本不存在
There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.

730
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,340
-我敢保证  -真的有
- I'm pretty fucking sure. - There could be.

731

能来点番茄酱吗  谢谢
Can we get some ketchup, please?

732
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,140
难道你们这帮人也不想挣钱吗
Do you guys not want to make money?

733

Shit, I can sell ludes to a convent full of nuns,

737
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,770
让她们淫水泛滥高潮迭起
and get them so horny they'd be fucking each other.

738
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,690
要的就是这个态度  没你卖不掉的东西是吗
That's the attitude. You can sell anything?

743
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,610
布拉德  教教他们该怎么做
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

744
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,200
把这支笔卖给我  都看好了  开始

00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,250
把你名字写那张餐巾纸上
Write your name down on that napkin for me.

749
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,370
可我没有笔呀
I don't have a pen.

750
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,170
卖给你了  这叫供需关系  伙计
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

751
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,330
-简直了  -我说什么来着
- Holy shit. - See what I'm saying?

752
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,790
他知道制造需求
He's creating urgency.

753
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,340
让他们心甘情愿去买股票
Get them to want to buy the stock.

754
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,300
让他们相信这是不可或缺的  明白吗
Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean?

755
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,550
关键就在这
And that's the thing.

756
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,130
修女全是同性恋
All nuns are lesbians.

757
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,140
你他妈又扯到哪儿去了  海獭
What the fuck are you talking about, Otter?

758
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,180
想想看  在修道院钓不到凯子
Think about it. They can't keep a dude

759
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,010
只好玩女人喽
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

760
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,220
我喊了四遍了  几米  第四遍了
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

761
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,770
他没跟上我们的思路
He's not with us.

762
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,190
她终于拿来了
Now she runs.

763
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,150
这帮人是没念过哈佛工商管理硕士什么的
But look. I knew these guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.

764
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,930
罗比·范伯格  外号笨蛋
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,

765
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,150
用了5年才高中毕业
took five years to finish high school.

766
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,150
奥尔登·古佛博格  外号海獭  高中都没念完
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter, didn't even graduate.

767
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,630
切斯特·明  外号颓废华人
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,

768
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,490
一直以为柔道是以色列人发明的
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

769
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,040
当中最聪明的要属尼基·克斯考夫
Smartest of the bunch was Nicky Koskoff.

770
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,790
他还真上过法学院
He actually went to law school.

771
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,290
我叫他鲁格拉特因为他那顶傻逼假发
I called him Rugrat because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

772
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,210
就算来的是一群年轻  饥渴的蠢货
Still, give them to me young, hungry and stupid,

773
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,340
要不了多久我都能让他们发财
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

774
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
我的天
Oh, my God.

775
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,140
乔丹  这
Jordan, that...

776
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,550
喜欢吗  宝贝
You like it, baby?

777
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,390
天哪  太漂亮了
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

778
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,890
这不是世界上最大的钻石
They're not the biggest stones in the world,

779
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,730
但我保证这都是上等货
but I promise they're really high quality.

780
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,190
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

781
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,190
真的很漂亮
They're so beautiful.

782
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,770
天哪
Oh, boy.

783
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
怎么了
What?

784
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,860
我见过你这副表情  怎么了  说吧
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

785
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,610
不知道  就是
I don't know, it's... You know...

786
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,490
这些股票  这些公司
These stocks... These companies...

787
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,620
都是一些不入流的公司啊
They're like crappy companies.

788
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,990
-没错  -是吧
- Well, yeah. - Okay.

789
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,450
没错  它们都糟透了
Yeah, they're terrible.

790
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,630
别担心  不是告诉过你吗
Don't worry about it. I told you,

791
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,000
我做的都是合法生意
what I'm doing is completely legal.

792
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,170
我知道
Yeah, I know.

793
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,380
但那些投资人其实挣不到钱  对吗
But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?

794
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
时有时无吧
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

795
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,760
投资本来就是这样的
You know how it goes.

796
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,390
那把这种股票卖给
Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people

797
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,430
不在乎这点小钱的富人不会更好吗
who can, like, afford to lose all that money?

798
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
当然
Of course.

799
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,850
但有钱人是不会买仙股的
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

800
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,810
事实就这样
They just don't.

801
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,480
为什么
Why not?

802
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,650
因为他们都混成精了
Because they're too smart, that's why not.

803
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,740
只要是读过大学的人
I mean, what person with a college education

804
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,920
有谁会相信这群混混呢
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

805
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,410
把电话挂了  说一会打回去
Hang up the phone. Tell him you'll call him back.

806
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,580
我他妈这正谈着5000块的生意呢
I got five fucking grand on the phone right now!

807
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,750
不过要是他们听起来不像混混呢
But what if they didn't sound like a bunch of jerk-offs?

808
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,080
如果我教会他们怎么向有钱人推销呢
What if I could teach them how to sell to people with money?

809
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,670
真正的有钱人
Real money.

810
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,920
所以我决定重新打造整个公司
So I decided to reinvent the company.

811
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,510
先生们  欢迎来到斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特
Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

812
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,680
你们现在的目标是拿下美国那1%的首富
You schnooks will now be targeting the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

813
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,810
要捞就要捞大鱼
We're talking about whales here.

814
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,770
就他妈《白鲸记》里那种
Moby fucking Dicks.

815
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:31,990
{\an8}《白鲸记》美国著名小说
描写主人公亚哈船长追逐并杀死白鲸莫比·迪克的经历

816
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,060
这份推销词  就是你们的鱼叉
And with this script, which is now your new harpoon,

817
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,230
我将教会你们每一个人
I'm gonna teach each and every one of you

818
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,990
如何成为他妈的亚哈船长
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

819
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,700
懂了吗
Get it? Huh?

820
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,160
什么船长
Captain who?

821
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,660
亚哈船长  就他妈的是
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

822
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,330
那本书里来的  你这蠢货  书里的
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

823
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,410
动动你的脑子
Turn your fucking brain on.

824
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
-去你妈的  -我操  罗比
- Fuck you. - Jesus fuck, Robbie.

825
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,920
听我说  我们这家新公司有说法的
Listen to me. We're a new company with a new name.

826
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,170
一家让客户放心的公司
A company that our clients can believe in.

827
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,170
一家让客户信任的公司
A company that our clients can trust.

828
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,800
一家在华尔街根基深厚的公司
A firm whose roots are so deeply embedded into Wall Street

829
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:01,310
{\an8}五月花号是英国移民驶往北美最为著名的一艘船只

830
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,310
当年的创始人乘着五月花号破浪而来
that our very founders sailed over on the Mayflower

831
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,230
将斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特这个名字
and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont

832
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,600
镌刻在普里茅斯的坚岩上
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

833
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,600
{\an8}普里茅斯岩为新移民踏上美洲大陆的第一块石头

834
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,980
明白了吗
You got it?

835
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,230
我们的具体计划是
What we're gonna do is this.

836
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,250
我们先推销像迪斯尼  ATT  IBM
First we pitch 'em Disney, ATT, IBM,

837
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,250
{\an8}分别为美国电话电报公司  国际商业机器公司

838
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,490
这种蓝筹热门股
blue chip stocks exclusively.

839
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,740
他们熟知的这种大公司
Companies these people know.

840
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,870
等他们放松警惕  我们就开始卖狗屎
Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit.

841
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,660
粉单和仙股才是我们的聚宝盆
The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money.

842
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
我们从中抽五成呢  乖乖
50% commission, baby.

843
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,000
用这种策略盈利的关键在于
Now the key to making money in a situation like this

844
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,090
一定要先下手为强
is to position yourself now before the settlement.

845
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,090
等《华尔街日报》都报道了再行动
Because by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal,

846
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,050
就为时已晚了
it's already too late.

847
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,260
然后你要做的就是等待
Then you wait.

848
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,430
耐心等待
You wait.

849
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,100
谁先开口谁傻逼
And whoever speaks first loses.

850
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,350
抱歉
Sorry...

851
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,940
感谢您来电告知我
I appreciate the call.

852
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,680
我得考虑考虑
I really have to give this some thought

853
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,230
再和我太太商量一下
and talk to my wife about it.

854
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,650
我想好了再给您答复可以吗
Can I call you back?

855
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,030
他们在犹豫  对吧  他们得考虑考虑
They don't know, right? They gotta think about it,

856
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,520
得他妈问老婆
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,

857
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,490
或者去问他妈的牙仙什么的
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

858
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,490
{\an8}美国民间传说中的精灵

859
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,370
但那些都不是关键
Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say.

860
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
唯一让他们不敢砸钱的原因就是
The only real objection that they have

861
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,950
他们并不相信你们这帮人
is that they don't trust you guys.

862
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,520
公司血统
商机紧迫

863
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,660
他们凭什么相信你们  看看你们自己
And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you.

864
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,500
就一帮没文化的推销员  对吧
You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right?

865
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,290
那你们该怎么办呢
So, what do you say?

866
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,550
要是我能让你7美元买进联合碳化物
You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at seven

867
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,050
再32美元卖出
and took you out at 32.

868
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,720
11美元买入德州仪器  47美元卖出
Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47.

869
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,260
16美元买入美国钢铁公司  41美元卖出
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41.

870
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,130
你现在肯定跟我说
You wouldn't be saying to me right now,

871
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,890
切斯特  快帮我给迪斯尼投几千股吧
"Chester, pick me up a few thousand shares of Disney!"

872
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,100
立刻  现在  赶快买
"On the spot, right now. Come on."

873
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,520
说真的  凯文  说真的  不是吗
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

874
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,940
我都不认识你
I don't know you.

875
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,310
你我陌不相识  你就给我电话陌生拜访
You cold-called me. You're a total stranger.

876
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,860
我表示完全同意
I am in complete agreement with you.

877
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,230
我们互不相识
You don't know me, I don't know you.

878
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,940
请允许我做个自我介绍  我叫奥尔登·古佛博格
Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Alden Kupferberg.

879
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,360
-我叫罗比·范伯格  -我叫切斯特·明
- Robbie Feinberg. - Chester Ming.

880

我现在是斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的高级副总裁
I'm Senior Vice President at Stratton Oakmont,

881
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,780
我计划在明年内成为
and I plan on being one of the...

882
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,160
我公司顶尖的股票经纪人之一
top brokers in my firm next year.

883
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,160
我要迈错一步可就没戏了  斯坦利
And I'm not gonna get there by being wrong, Stanley.

884
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,250
我不得不说  你听起来像是个
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

885
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,080
你像是个实诚人
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

886
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,420
这投资不会让你一夜暴富或赤贫
It's not gonna make you rich and it's not gonna make you poor.

887
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,960
但这次交易绝对会成为
But what this trade will do is serve as...

888
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,300
未来交易的标杆  凯文
a benchmark for future business, Kevin.

889
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
现在说话舒服多了吧  斯科蒂
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

890
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,590
然后你就能确信了
And then you'll know for sure

891
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,720
自己终于在华尔街找了个能信赖的
that you finally found a broker on Wall Street

892
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,350
股票经纪人

00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,290
唐尼和我决定趁周六下午
Donnie and I decided to double-team her

1039
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,240
我俩妻子去买圣诞礼服时
on a Saturday afternoon while our wives were out

1040
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,380
和她来个二夹一
shopping for Christmas dresses.

1041
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,050
后来本娶了她
Eventually, Ben married her,

1042
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,090
我们都觉得挺神奇的
which was pretty amazing

1043
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,970
因为她给办公室所有男的都吹过箫
considering she blew every single guy in the office.

1044
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,310
本后来因为抑郁3年后自杀了
Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later.

1045
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,850
我雇了我爸麦克斯做执行官来维持秩序
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer.

1046
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,600
斯特拉顿自己的盖世太保
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

1047
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,480
我们叫他疯狂麦克斯因为他的急脾气
We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,

1048
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,950
简直一触即发
which could be set off by

1049
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,490
连电话铃这点小事都能惹到他
something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

1050
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,280
谁这么厚颜无耻
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1051
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,990
周二晚上给我家打电话
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

1052
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,250
真该死
God damn it!

1053
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,370
你要错过片头了
You're gonna miss it!

1054
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,290
拜托说点新鲜的
Please, tell me something I don't know.

1055
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,130
我等一星期就为了看《均衡》
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

1056
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,500
他们就非得这时候... 你好
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1057
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,300
但一接起电话
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

1058
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,670
吉尼  最近怎么样  吉尼
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1059
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
他就开始用很奇怪的英国腔说话
... he'd affect this weird British accent.

1060
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,010
好的  吉尼  那太好了
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1061
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,300
回见
Cheerio.

1062
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,430
特别的奇怪
It was absolutely bizarre.

1063
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,060
这该死的白痴
The fucking halfwit!

1064
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,180
-等他挂了电话  -你错过片头了
- He'd hang up... - You missed it!

1065
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,520
就又变回疯狂麦克斯了
... and then he's Mad Max all over again.

1066
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,650
该死
Damn it!

1067
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,940
告诉我刚讲什么了  怎么了
All right, tell me what happened. What happened?

1068
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,150
他发现是他姑姑
Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister.

1069
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,650
他是谁  告诉我是谁
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1070
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,320
主角啊  你知道主角...
The main guy. You know who the main...

1071
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,490
主角
The main guy...

1072
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,910
是他姑姑  他发现她死了
It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.

1073
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,950
当然我们在斯特拉做的事情
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

1074
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,700
不用都让疯狂麦克斯知道
everything we were doing at Stratton.

1075
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,830
弄一个大的靶子  我们...
And then there's a big target and we...

1076
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,870
把他们扔向靶子  然后就粘上了
They get launched at the target. They stick.

1077
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,080
靶心里画个美元符号
There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

1078
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,250
扔得离靶心最近的
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

1079
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,300
得分最高
gets the most points.

1080
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,590
等着我把那小崩豆扔傻了
I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing.

1081
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,590
要是他受伤了怎么办
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1082
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,970
到时我们肯定很疯狂
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

1083
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,300
我觉得我们伤不到他们  他们可...
I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like...

1084
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,140
他们都结实得跟超人一样
They got like superhuman strength.

1085
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,430
我觉得他不会有事的
I think he's gonna be fine.

1086
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,470
你别瞪着他眼睛看就行
You can't look him right in the eyes.

1087
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,680
别瞪着他眼睛看
You can't look him in the eye?

1088
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,440
认真的  我看PBS台说的
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1089
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,400
他们会被你看毛然后发疯的
They get confused and their wires get crossed.

1090
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,020
你得看着他们的下巴
You gotta look at their chin.

1091
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,150
看着像是我在看你
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

1092
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,230
但其实我在看你下巴
but I'm looking at your chin.

1093
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,010
我感觉你在跟我说话
I feel like you're addressing me right now,

1094
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,480
但你没在跟我说话吧
but you're not, are you?

1095
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,450
他们就像蒙娜丽莎一样  不管你站哪里
They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact,

1096
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,070
他们都能直视你
like, wherever you are standing in the room.

1097
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,360
然后就锁定了
And they lock in.

1098
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,080
但我们还是有个限度的对吧
No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?

1099
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,290
可以向他们身上扔东西
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1100
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,790
我们可以扔吃的吗  香蕉
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

1101
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,330
随便什么吃的  没错
Any food. Correct.

1102
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,460
但举个例子  我就不大会
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

1103
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,290
让他把鸡巴掏出来
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

1104
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,080
然后找几个妹子
and like get some of the girls to, you know,

1105
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,250
玩他什么的
fondle him and shit like that.

1106
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
那也...不能这么干吗
That would be... That's unacceptable?

1107
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
这招我们先留着
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1108
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,510
这人比较适合往靶子上扔
This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.

1109
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,590
对  对  没错
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1110
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,050
他们就适合干这个使
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1111
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,180
天生就适合被拿来当飞镖扔
They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.

1112
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,470
跟飞镖一样头重脚轻
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1113
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
就是为了让你能投准的
So they're built for accuracy.

1114
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,600
天哪  我们能把他滚着玩么
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1115
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,770
那是他兄弟  罗比
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1116
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,190
罗比才是保龄球
His brother's the bowling ball.

1117
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,980
给他身上绑个滑板
The brother, you put a skateboard on him,

1118
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,360
把他绑在滑板上
you strap him to a skateboard,

1119
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,810
然后顺着过道往瓶子上扔
you toss him down an alley at some pins.

1120
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,520
-这想法不错  -绝对的
- No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.

1121
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,610
-这个我们也要吧  -没错我们俩都要
- Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1122
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,780
但这上面说他兄弟同意露阴
But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.

1123
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,110
-他倒是不长高  -他同意吗
- Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?

1124
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,490
但他们挺易怒的
They are very ornery by the way,

1125
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,950
所以跟这些小不点得悠着点
so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.

1126
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,080
安全第一
Safety first.

1127
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,240
安全第一  好吧
Safety is first, all right?

1128
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,200
在旁边安排一个人拿着麻醉枪
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun

1129
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,910
出事儿了就击晕他
ready to knock this fucker out.

1130
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,170
-我们要不要弄个...-梅斯催泪  高压枪
- Do we want to get like a... - Mace. Taser guns.

1131
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,250
小气枪怎么样
A pellet gun maybe?

1132
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,460
不行  小气枪会伤到他的
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1133
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,880
我只想弄晕他  晕死就行
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1134
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,550
要我说我们还是认准法律漏洞
But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?

1135
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,550
要是我们不把他到人看
If we don't consider him a human,

1136
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,760
就单纯的行为来讲  我们就没事
we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear.

1137
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,890
就像飞天瓦伦达马戏团
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1138
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,930
死了不少人也没人告他们
You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody.

1139
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,770
重要的是你们得记住
The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind

1140
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,680
他们互相会八卦的
is that these things gossip.

1141
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,390
聚在一起就八卦
They get together and they gossip.

1142
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,850
-这点好  -我们最不希望看到的
- That's a good point. - And the last thing

1143
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,110
就是他们聚到一起然后说
that we need is them getting together and saying,

1144
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,770
他们嘲笑我们了
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1145
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,440
那会抹黑斯特拉顿的
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1146
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,610
我就爱你这点  能想到这些破事
That's why I love you. You think of shit like that.

1147
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
等他们来了  就把他们当自己人  好吗
When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1148
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,080
自己人  咕咕咕咕  自己人
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1149
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,740
接纳他们  自己人
We accept them, one of us!

1150
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,540
咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1151
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,960
接纳他们  自己人
We accept them, one of us.

1152
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,080
咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1153
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,460
乔丹  你爸来了
Jordan! Your Dad's coming.

1154
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,000
好像是运通卡账单的事
Something about the American Express bill.

1155
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,250
你能别让他来吗
Can you get him out of here?

1156
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,500
能  你舔蛋去吧
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1157
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,840
没  我认真的
No, I'm serious!

1158
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,260
该死  各位  假装我们在工作
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1159
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,800
你他妈有股票单吗
You got any fucking stock forms?

1160
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,430
他来了  他来了
He's coming, he's coming.

1161
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,680
随便编点什么
Make some shit up.

1162
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,760
我觉得要是我们把辉瑞制药...
I think if we short Pfizer...

1163
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,770
一个月43万吗  乔丹
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1164
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,850
你他妈的一个月
Four hundred and fucking

1165
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,190
居然他妈的花43万吗
30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1166
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
早上好  那都是商务花费  淡定点
Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.

1167
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,740
-商务花费吗  -是
- Business expenses? - Yes.

1168
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,240
-乔丹  你看你这都是什么  -什么
- Jordy, look what you got here. - What?

1169
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,200
看这个  两万六美金一顿晚饭
Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!

1170
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,990
不  这我能解释
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1171
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,500
爸  我们有客户的  辉瑞制药的客户
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1172
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,460
没错  阿根廷的上等腰肉牛排
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1173
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,790
还得买上等的香槟  都很贵的
Expensive champagne and... We had to buy champagne.

1174
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,380
然后你还点了一堆狗屁配菜
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1175
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,420
-你自己跟他说  -我点了配菜  所以
- Tell him about the sides. - I ordered sides, so...

1176
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,970
还配菜  26万块的配菜吗
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1177
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,390
你这配菜治癌症的吗
What are these sides? They cure cancer?

1178
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,350
问题是配菜的确治癌症
The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.

1179
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,850
所以才这么贵
That's why they were expensive.

1180

-你他妈闭嘴吧  -我认真的

你看这么形容合适不
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1190
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,160
的确是这样  但这都不是我干的
That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me.

1191
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,580
这都是他们干的
This is all of them.

1192
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,460
-是吗  都是我们干的  -反正不是我

I know you're upset about the dinner,

1204
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,980
你有道理生气
and that makes sense because

1205
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,010
因为我们的确花太多了
we did spend too much money.

1206
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,810
但我说的就是旅行娱乐
But I said T&E.

1207

That's what I'm saying. I want you to open up more, Max.

1214
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,660
你等着他哪天杀了你
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1215
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,280
你干嘛憋着  你干嘛都憋着
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1216
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,080
麦克斯  你干嘛非都憋着
Max, why do you hold it in?

1217

够了  你他妈给我滚出去

嫖什么妓女还能刷信用卡
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1220
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,580
有钱的
A rich one.

得花300到400美金
They cost between $300 and $500

1224
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,840
你要是不想带套就得多给小费
and you had to wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip,

1225
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,800
当然我每次都给
which, of course, I always did.

1226
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,510
然后就是纳斯达克股  漂亮但活一般
Then came the NASDAQs, who were pretty, not great.

1227
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,930
大概200到300块钱

They cost about 100 or less.

1230
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,480
要是你不戴套的话
If you didn't wear a condom,

1231
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,020
第二天就得去打青霉素了
you'd have to get a penicillin shot the next day

1232
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,280
还得祈祷自己的老二别烂了
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

1233
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,190
倒不是说这种我们就不干了
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

1234
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,110
相信我  我们都干了
Believe me, we did.

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,500
不是很好
Well, not the best.

1241
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,130
她就是有点...你懂吧
She just doesn't... You know what I'm saying?

1242
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,710
好像气味啊
It's like the smell...

1243
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,380
有种气味  吸引力什么的
There's a smell, there's an attraction thing.

-本来就  -婚姻就这样  知道吗

1247
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,510
我和你妈结婚很长时间了
Your mother and I, we've been married a long, long time.

1248
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,770
你难道觉得我们俩
What do you think? We're...

1249
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,680
每两分钟就得上个床吗
We're jumping into bed every two minutes?

1250
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,140
-那可不行  -我很爱她
- It doesn't work that way. - I love her to death.

1251
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
爸  我不想离婚  但是
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

爹  她们现在的活儿
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1257
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,820
绝对是更新换代了
I mean... I mean, it's on a whole other level.

1258
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,490
-是吗  -下边还都剃光了

从眉毛往下就没毛了
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1267

Wow. A new world.

1269
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,890

其实我从来不喜欢阴毛
I've never been a fan of the bush, to be honest.

看你都找些什么蠢货给你工作
Look at the knuckleheads you got working for you.

1278
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,110
但我得让他们羡慕我的生活  懂吗
but I need them to want to live like me, you get it?

1279
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,570
想过得像我一样
To live like me.

1280
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,030
乔丹
Jordy.

1281
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,870
你这么折腾早晚遭报应
One of these days, the chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1282
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,660
你觉得我疯了吗

1283
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,130
疯了  你这叫伤风败俗
Crazy? This is obscene.

1284
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,750
的确伤风败俗
It was obscene.

1285
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,460
在现实世界中的确如此
In the normal world.

1286
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
但谁愿意活在现实中
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1287
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,800
一起狂欢到屌炸天吧
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1288
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,770
我们将成为华尔街的
We are about to become fucking legends

1289
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,730
传奇
on Wall Street!

1290
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,320
我们的规划将带领公司
We got plans up here that's gonna take this company

1291
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,360
一路冲上平流层
into the fucking stratosphere!

1292
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,120
狼仔  狼仔
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1293
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,910
去他妈的梅林银行  管他呢
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1294
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,980
凭什么总让他们
Why should they be taking

1295
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,540
赚走我们的钱
all our fucking money all the fucking time?

1296
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,790
这样我们就是证券承销商了
This way we become the underwriters.

1297
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,420
我们下一步棋
It was our next big move.

1298
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,090
就是找公司帮他们做首次公开募股
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1299
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,970
这有这样  那些华尔街的小崽子们
It was the only way these Wall Street pricks

1300
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,760
才能不把我们当做野鸡证券交易所
would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1301
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,050
我们还有阿克利夫国际
We got Arncliffe International.

1302
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,680
我们做事比较不寻常
See, we were a little different.

1303
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,100
我们谈正事的时候
We liked to get as fucked up as possible

1304
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,350
喜欢嗑药并喝得酩酊大醉
during our business powwows

1305
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,890
这样才能才思泉涌
in order to stimulate our free-flowing ideas,

1306
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,980
所以我们吃安眠酮就像吃巧克力豆一样
which is why we were popping these ludes like they were M&M's.

1307
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,150
史蒂夫·麦登
Steve Madden.

1308
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,820
那家公司归我们了
We own the fucking companies...

1309
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,700
绝对归我们了
We own the companies...

1310
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,700
不知道安眠酮是什么  我告诉你
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1311
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,830
等等  等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1312
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,550
貌似安眠酮
Looks like those ludes

1313
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,660
正在唐尼身上显神迹呢
are working their magic on Donnie right now.

1314
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,450
镇定安眠酮
The Quaalude,

1315
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,450
一般叫作安眠酮
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1316
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,940
于1951年由一位印度医生首次合成
was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor,

1317
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,790
是点红点的印度人  不是印第安人
 that's dots, not feathers,

1318
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,600
当时被当做镇定催眠药开给
as a sedative, and was prescribed to

1319
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,210
压力大的家庭妇女缓解睡眠障碍的
stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders.

1320
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,130
但很快就有人发现
But pretty soon someone figured out

1321
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,970
服药后只要忍住15分钟不睡
that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just 15 minutes,

1322
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,390
就能爽翻天了
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1323
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,390

And in 1982, the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.

1325
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,900
列为了一级管控药物
Along with the rest of the world.

1326
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,280
所以说安眠酮数量有限越吃越少
Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.

1327
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,320
认真的  买都买不到
No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore.

你叫了一些朋友来对吧

1551
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,040
莫名其妙的局势就失控了
One thing led to another. Things got out of hand.

1552

这我们可以理解

但有人从我的公寓里偷了钱

我说过了  我不知道您的钱在哪
Like I said, I don't know where your money is.

我们从头开始  都有谁来
Just start from the beginning. Who came over?

我知道你们下一天才回来

以免他们把那个可怜的家伙杀了

我给了他们每人1000块

1616
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,410
老鼠仓就是朋友开的户  比如布拉德
Now a rathole is a friend, like Brad here,

1617
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:22,040
他以他的名义帮我持有股票

1618
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,370
你是谁  犹太人版杰克·尼克劳斯吗
Who are you supposed to be, huh? Jack Nickle-Jew?

1619

{\an8}杰克·尼克劳斯  美国著名高尔夫运动员

1620
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,160
我把价格抬上去后
I'd drive the price up then

1621
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,250
他把股票卖掉  然后把大部分利润还给
he'd sell and kick most of the profits back to...

1622
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,170
没错  给我
You guessed it, me.

1623
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,470
都是现金  都不在账上
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1624
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,850
当然是违法的
A big no-no, of course, in the eyes of the law.

1625
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,850
我们有了新的证券律师  曼尼·瑞丝金

我们付他每小时700元听他的恐吓
700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1627
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,440
听着  你要是招惹了证监会
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1628
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,730
一定会吃不了兜着走
you end up with your tits in a wringer.

1629
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,820
不过别担心  证监会的我已经打点好了
Do not worry about it. I have the SEC under control.

1630
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,650
这些傻逼们在干嘛
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1631
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,490
你们在搞什么玩意儿
What are you doing? Hey!

1632
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,530
证监会的人来了
We got the SEC in here.

1633
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700

我把他们安排在了会议室
So I set them up in our conference room

1636
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,540
放了窃听器
and I had it bugged

1637
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,840
把空调开到最猛
and the air conditioning turned up so high

1638
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,460
让里面冷得像南极一样
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1639
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,510
这一直都这么冷吗
Is it always this cold in here?

1640
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,630
不知道
I don't know.

1641
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,880
当他们在那里
Then, while they were looking

1642
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,390
寻找我的罪证时
for a smoking gun in that room...

1643
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,260
阿克利夫国际现在很火
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1644
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,600
我正在这里大张旗鼓
I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1645
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,930
为我们的最近的IPO做准备
offering up our latest IPO.

1646
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,520
IPO的意思是首次公开募股
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1647
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,990
是指一家企业首次
It's the first time a stock

1648
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,360
将股票向公众出售

1649

作为负责上市的机构

1650
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,070
我们来制定发行价
we set the initial sales price

1651
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,910
再把股票卖回给我们的朋友  那些

1652
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,620
好吧
Look.

1653
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,580
我知道你压根不懂我在说什么
I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1654
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,620
没关系  无所谓
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1655
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,540
关键在于
The real question is this.

1656
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,500
这合法吗
"Was all this legal?"

1657
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,460
必须他妈的不合法
Absolutely fucking not.

1658
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,250
但我们能赚到多得不知道怎么花的钱
But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.

1659
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,760
在钱多得不知道怎么花的时候
And what do you do when you're making

1660
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,300
你要怎么花呢
more money than you know what to do with?

1661
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,730
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1662
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,770
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

1663
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,650
天啊

从飞机上就开始纵酒狂欢了
The flight there alone was a bacchanal.

1671

成家前的最后放纵
One last blowout for the gods before I settled down for good.

上百名斯特拉顿人

1673
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,710

落地了还有50个

1676
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,480
这么说吧  我们飞机
I mean, I tell you, our plane

1677
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,390
就像是插上翅膀的药房

01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,560
你真是个下流的妞
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1765
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,650
对了
That's right.

1766
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,030
对了  我忘了
That's right! I forgot.

1767
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,610
我都忘了  宝贝
I forgot, baby.

1768
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:56,030
唐尼和我在威尼斯投资了个酒店公寓
Donnie and I were investing in a condominium complex in Venice.

1769
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,240
所以你误会了
That's why all this confusion.

1770
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,870
你还去意大利投资了
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1771
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,660
不是意大利  是加州
Not Italy. California.

1772
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,250
-是吗  加州  -对
- Oh, California? - Yeah.

1773
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,460
鬼话连篇的混蛋
You're a lying piece of shit!

1774
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,710
公爵夫人  亲爱的
Duchess, baby, come on.

1775
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,330
你他妈别叫我夫人
Don't you fucking "Duchess" Me.

1776
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,880
别叫我夫人
Don't you "Duchess" Me!

1777
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,090
你以为我不知道你的小伎俩
Do you really think that I don't know what you're up to?

1778
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,090
-你是有孩子的人了  乔丹  -是啊
- You're a father now, Jordan. - Yeah.

1779
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,590
-你该像个父亲样  -我知道
- You're a father now. - I know...

1780
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,390
可你做事还那么幼稚
And you're still acting like an infant!

1781
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,350
去你妈的
God damn it!

1782
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,100
宝贝  你得管管你的臭脾气了
Baby, you know, you got real anger issues.

1783
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,520
是谁凌晨三点了
Who is the one who flew in here

1784
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,480
才开着傻逼直升机回来
at 3 in the morning on their stupid helicopter

1785
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,610
还吵醒了斯凯拉  是你
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1786
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,320
吵醒了斯凯拉  简直是屁话
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1787
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,130
你有注意过我刚给高尔夫场
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range

1788
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
铺了百慕大草吗  乔丹
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1789
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
{\an8}百慕大草  一种暖季型高尔夫用草

1790
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,550
-全都被你毁了  -天啊  百慕大草
- and now you fucking wrecked it! - Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1791
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,380
你连看都不看
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1792
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,550
也从来不和高尔夫球场的人打交道
and deal with the fucking golf course people!

1793
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,800
天啊
Oh, my God,

1794
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:00,430
你还得和球场的人打交道
you had to deal with the golf course people, too!

1795
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,180
真是悲剧啊  亲爱的  天啊
What a Greek tragedy, honey! Oh, my God!

1796
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,190
你是不是还得亲手付他们现金啊
You probably had to pay them in cash with your hands!

1797
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,480
辛苦你了
What a fucking burden.

1798
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,520
除了整天刷我的信用卡之外
And actually do some work

1799
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,730
还得做这么辛苦的事  是吧
besides swiping my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1800
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,530
我都跟不上你的职业变化了  亲爱的
Because I can't keep track of your professions, honey.

1801
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,490
上个月你还是红酒鉴定家
'Cause last month you were a wine connoisseur.

1802
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,620
现在又成了高雅的景观设计师
Now you're an aspiring landscape architect!

1803
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,370
-这么说吧...别  -去你妈的
- Let me get that right... No! - Fuck you!

1804
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,450
你敢把水泼来试试
Don't fucking dare throw that fucking water at me.

1805
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,000
你敢泼
Don't you fucking dare.

1806
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,370
冷静  亲爱的
All right, honey?

1807
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,960
你能不能...
Now will you just...

1808
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,920
我们谈谈吧  好吗
We could talk this out, all right?

1809
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,380
动口不动手  知道吗
We just use our words. You know?

1810
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,550
交流
Communicate.

1811
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,840
行吗
Okay?

1812
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,680
来吧  亲爱的
Come on, sweetheart.

1813
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,720
说说话  谈谈
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1814
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,890
别再秀肌肉了  乔丹
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1815
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,680
看着跟脑残一样
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1816
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,060
宝贝  别这样
Babe, come on.

1817
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,310
你丈夫身材这么好
You should feel happy you got a husband

1818
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,650
你该高兴啊
who's in such great shape like this, huh?

1819
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,690
过来
Come here.

1820
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,320
过来  亲亲我
Come on, give me a kiss.

1821
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,440
你看起来美极了
You look so beautiful right now.

1822
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,650
-来吧  -亲你?
- Come on. - Kiss you?

1823
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,900
-你好美啊  -亲你?
- You look so beautiful... - Kiss you?

1824
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,610
是啊  就亲一下
Yeah, give me one...

1825
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,910
操
Fuck you!

1826
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,990
没错  早晨的惯例
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1827
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,450
起床先跟内奥米
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1828
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,750
就前一晚的什么傻事吵架
about whatever it is I did the night before.

1829
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,040
然后蒸个桑拿
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1830
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,880
排掉留在身体里的毒品
the drugs still in my system.

1831
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,590
然后评估一下损失
Then I'd assess the damage.

1832
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,590
滴眼药水
Drown out my eyeballs.

1833
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,220
吃点"背痛药"  开始这一天
Take my "Back pills" To get the day started,

1834
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,390
然后想法儿跟内奥米和好
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1835
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,430
早上好  爸比
Good morning, Daddy.

1836
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,600
给人家的亲亲呢
Where's my kiss?

1837
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,060
小甜心
Hey, sweetheart.

1838
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,820
爸比可以跟两个甜心都亲亲吗
Does Daddy get a kiss from both of his little girls, huh?

1839
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,280
不行
Oh, no.

1840
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,450
爸比不能碰妈咪
No, Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy

1841
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,280
很久很久
for a very, very,

1842
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,120
都不能碰
very long time.

1843
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,410
爸比对刚才的话非常抱歉
Daddy's really sorry about what he said in the other room.

1844
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,700
那都是气话
He didn't mean any of it.

1845
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,080
爸比不用浪费口舌
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1846
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,210
从现在起
And from now on,

1847
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,790
妈咪在家只会穿
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1848
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,210
超短的小裙子了
short skirts around the house.

1849
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,300
你知道吗  爸比
And you know something else, Daddy?

1850
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,940
妈咪好讨厌穿小内裤啊
Mommy is just so sick and tired of wearing panties.

1851

In fact,

1853

她已经把内裤
she's decided to throw them

1854
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,990
都丢掉了
all away.

1855
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,670
看好了  爸比
So take a good look, Daddy.

1856
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,130
以后在家会经常看到哦
You're gonna be seeing an awful lot of this around the house.

1857
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,750
宝贝
Oh, baby...

1858
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,300

宝贝
Baby.

1863
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,850

1868
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,210
他的眼睛有点奇怪  是吧
His eyes seem to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1869
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,170
是啊  眼睛有点奇怪
Yeah, there's something a little bit different about his eyes.

1870

没错  是的  打个招呼  妈咪

Of all the fucking days,

她偏偏挑今天来挑逗我

01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,960
伟大的美国鞋匠
The great American cobbler.

1914
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,420
炙手可热的女鞋制造者
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1915
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,240
多亏了唐尼
And thanks to Donnie,

1916
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,090
我们才能帮他的公司上市
we were taking his company public.

1917
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,880
斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特爬出原始的泥泞
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out of the primordial ooze.

1918
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,970
再也不是井底之蛙了
Pond scum no more.

1919
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,590
所以得让他们见见你
That's why they gotta see your face.

1920
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,560
你要鼓舞士气
You get them fired up so

1921
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,140
大家才能拼命卖股票  好吗
they push the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1922
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,810
不仅如此  唐尼和我
And not only that, Donnie and I secretly owned

1923
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,190
秘密持有史蒂夫·麦登鞋业85%的股份
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1924
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:41,770
这是法律绝对不允许的
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1925
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,230
但我们打算着狠狠捞上一笔
but we'd get filthy fucking rich if our troops got behind it.

1926
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,820
我们要鼓舞士气
Our job was to get them worked up.

1927
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,700
但也不能太士气高涨了
But not too worked up.

1928
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,490
大家好
Hello. If...

1929
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,700
如果有不认识我的
For those of you who don't know me...

1930
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,040
我叫史蒂夫·麦登
My name's Steve Madden.

1931
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,660
我们知道你是谁
Yeah, we know who you are.

1932
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,250
盒子上都印着你的名字呢
Your name is on the box.

1933
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,000
拿鞋子  给他们看看鞋子
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1934
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,670
-给他们看看鞋子  -好
- Show them the shoes. - Okay. Yeah.

1935
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,960
这鞋子很酷的
Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool.

1936
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,910
叫玛丽璐
This is the Mary Lou,

1937
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,880
我的成名作
which is really the shoe that put me on the map.

1938
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,550
如果没有它  我就不会站在这
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1939
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,800
这是给胖妞穿的
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1940
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850
不管你信不信
Believe it or not... Believe it or not though,

1941
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,220
玛丽璐实际上和玛丽珍同款
the Mary Lou is actually the

1942
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,220
{\an8}玛丽珍  背带式平底女鞋

1943
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,270
只不过是黑色皮质的
same as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1944
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,570
反击  是谁扔的  是谁扔的
Fight back! Come on! Where you at? Where you at?

1945
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,150
好了
All right!

1946
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,490
掌声送给史蒂夫·麦登和他超赞的玛丽璐
Let's give it up for Steve Madden and his awesome Mary Lou!

1947
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,740
举起来  举起来  自豪地举起来
Hold that up. Hold that up. Hold that up proud!

1948
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,290
掌声献上
Give him a round of applause!

1949
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,620
发泄完了吗
You guys got that out of your systems, huh?

1950
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,580
下午过得怎么样
You having a good afternoon or what?

1951
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,170
我要花点时间  告诉你们
I wanna take a moment and tell you why Steve here is so

1952
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,550
为什么说史蒂夫与众不同
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1953
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,340
因为他是个创作天才
It's because this man is a creative genius.

1954
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:58,430
史蒂夫的能力和天赋
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1955
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,850
不是紧跟女鞋时尚潮流
it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1956
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,690
而是他  能引领潮流
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1957
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,440
懂吗
You understand?

1958
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,730
史蒂夫这样的艺术家十年难遇
Artists like Steve come along once every decade.

1959
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:12,250
就像乔治· 阿玛尼  詹尼·范思哲
I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace,

1960
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,240
可可·香奈儿

伊夫圣罗兰
Yves Saint Laurent.

1962
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,030
史蒂夫  过来一下
Steve, come over here for a second.

1963
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,290
你们可能没有意识到
I don't think you all realize

1964
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,330
史蒂夫·麦登
that Steve Madden

1965
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,960
是女鞋界最炙手可热的人物
is the hottest person in the women's shoe industry,

1966
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,330
北美的每一家百货商场
with orders going through the roof

1967
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,750
他的订单都多到满天飞
at every department store in North America right now.

1968
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,260
我们竟有幸邀请他来办公室
We have him here in our office!

1969
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,090
谢天谢地  他来了
We should thank our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1970
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,760
我们应该五体投地
We should be on our hands and knees right now,

1971
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,930
给他跪舔
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1972
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,560
像这样  知道吗
Like this! Okay?

1973
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,440
我要跪舔你的鸡鸡  史蒂夫
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1974
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,900
大家都想给你跪舔
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1975
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,770
这就是我们进入
This is our golden ticket

1976
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,280
巧克力工厂的金奖券
to the fucking chocolate factory right here!

1977
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,320
我要的是
And I wanna meet

1978
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,660
威利·旺卡那样的魔法人物
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1979
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,160
要像奥柏伦柏人那样疯狂一次
I wanna be with the fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1980
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,670
好了  下去吧  下去
All right, get off this fucking stage! Get out of here.

1981
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,540
大家都听好了
All right, I want all of you to focus for a second.

1982
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,090
看到那些小黑盒子了吗
See those little black boxes?

1983
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,420
那叫电话
They're called telephones.

1984
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,260
告诉你们一个关于电话的小秘密
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones.

1985
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,930
它们不会自己拨号  知道吗
They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay?

1986
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,770
没有你们  它们只是快没用的塑料
Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic.

1987
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,830
就像上膛的M16
Like a loaded M16

1988
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,980
却没有扣动扳机的士兵
without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1989
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,440
而这些电话存在的意义
And in the case of the telephone,

1990
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,230
就取决于在座的各位
it's up to each and every one of you,

1991
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,820
我训练有素的斯特拉顿人
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1992
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,240
我的杀手们
My killers!

1993
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:43,290
杀手们  不能接受否定的答案
My killers, who will not take no for an answer!

1994
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,750
我的战士们
My fucking warriors,

1995
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,210
决不轻易挂断电话
who will not hang up the phone

1996
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:51,290
直到客户被拿下
until their client either buys

1997
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,550
或者他妈死球
or fucking dies!

1998
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,100
让我来告诉你们一件事
Let me tell you something.

1999
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:13,190
没钱是装不了贵公子的
There is no nobility in poverty.

2000
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,000
我可能成为一个富人
I have been a rich man

2001
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,650
也可能成为一个穷人
and I have been a poor man.

2002
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,160
我每次都他妈选择当富人
And I choose rich every fucking time.

2003
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,470
因为作为一个富人
Because at least as a rich man,

2004
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,080
当我要面对什么问题时
when I have to face my problems,

2005
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,220
我起码可以坐在加长豪车后座出场
I show up in the back of a limo,

2006
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,000
穿着一身两千美元的西服
wearing a $2,000 suit

2007
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,670
带着四万美元他妈一块的金表
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

2008
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,000
打一架  揍他
Duke it out! Hit him!

2009
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,510
从我身上他妈滚下来
Get the fuck off me!

2010
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:42,140
假如这儿有任何人觉得我肤浅或者物质
And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic,

2011
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,510
那你去他妈的麦当劳找份工作吧
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

2012
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
因为那里才是你他妈该去的地方
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

2013
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:52,270
但在你离开这间满是胜者的房间之前
But before you depart this room full of winners,

2014
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,150
我希望你能好好看看你身边的人  看吧
I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on.

2015
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,400
因为在不远的将来
Because sometime in the not-so-distant future,

2016
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,160
你会开着一辆破破烂烂的福特斑马
you're gonna be pulling up to

2017
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,280
在红灯前停下
a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

2018
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,660
而那个人会开着一辆崭新的保时捷
and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you

2019
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,870
停在你旁边
in their brand new Porsche

2020
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,710
身旁还坐着他们漂亮的
with their beautiful wife by their side,

2021
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,790
有一对大奶子的妻子
who's got big voluptuous tits.

2022
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,710
而你身边会坐着谁呢
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

2023
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,090
某头恶心的角马  满嘴唇毛
Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,

2024
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,510
穿着件无袖长袍
in a sleeveless muumuu,

2025
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,350
挤进你身边
crammed in next to you

2026
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,810
带着一满车从他妈折扣批发超市买的杂物
in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

2027
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,180
那就是将来坐在你身边的人
That's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

2028
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,520
所以你们听我说  而且听仔细了
So you listen to me and you listen well.

2029
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,860
你是不是还有信用卡账单没付清
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

2030
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,440
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2031
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,840
你的房东是不是准备赶你出门了
Is your landlord ready to evict you?

2032
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,860
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2033
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,240
你女朋友是否觉得你他妈就是个屌丝
Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser?

2034
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,370
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2035
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,000
我希望你们能赚够钱去解决这些问题
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!

2036
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,460
你们今天唯一需要做的就是拿起那台电话
All you have to do today is pick up that phone

2037
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,510
然后说出我教你们说的话
and speak the words that I have taught you.

2038
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,760
然后我就能让你们变得
And I will make you richer

2039
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,900
比美利坚他妈合众国
than the most powerful

2040
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,930
大部分有权有势的CEO都富有
CEO in the United States of fucking America!

2041
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,180
好
Yeah!

2042
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,600

Fuck, yeah!

2043
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,310
我希望你们上场
I want you to go out there

2044
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,860
然后把史蒂夫·麦登的股票
and I want you to ram

2045
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:19,440
塞进你客户的喉咙
Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats

2046
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,820
直到他们噎住为止
until they fucking choke on it!

2047
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,880
直到他们噎死而且买了十万股为止
Till they choke on it and they buy 100,000 shares!

2048
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,490
那就是我想要的
That's what I want.

2049
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,120
好  太他妈好了
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

你们要当他妈的电话恐怖分子
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

2053
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:40,300
现在  让我们把这操蛋的东西踢出去吧
Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!

2054
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:11,520
下午一点
At 1:00 p.m.,

2055
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,330
我们以每股四块五美元的价格开市
we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,540
到一点零三分  股价就超过了十八美元
By 1:03, it was over $18.

2057

你以前来过这种地方吗

我的意思是我把前面整个加长
I mean I had the whole front extended

2178
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,450

2184
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:30,310
-确实如此  -听着  我的重点是

2186
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:35,630
但我想我一辈子也想不通是为什么
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

2187
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,380
我知道我们是有点不正统
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2188
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,180
我们做事有点大张旗鼓
we're a little loud in the way we do things.

2189
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,390
但是你得理解
But you gotta understand,

2190
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,930
我们是新入行的  你懂
we're the new guys on the block, you know,

2191
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,140
我们在努力让自己名扬万里

但我希望你明白  我们不做违法的事

无论如何也不做
Whatsoever.

2194
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,360
你可以去找证监会的人
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2195
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,490
他们过去六个月来我办公室拜访了十五次
They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.

01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,200
我是说  我没...我没什么要隐瞒的
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2197
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,030
你知道证监会只是个民事管理机构
Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency.

2198
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,660
而我们查的是犯罪活动
We pursue criminal activities.

2199
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,580
正是这样  你要查的是真正的犯罪
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2200
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,210
这让我很好奇你们为什么会调查我
which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?

2201
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,670
我是说  说实话...
I mean, honestly...

2202
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,540
你觉得我们做过什么或者在做什么吗
what is it that you think that we did or do?

2203
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,590
我不明白
I don't get it.

2204
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:15,970
我...
Well, I...

2205
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,470
乔丹  我不能讨论正在进行的调查
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.

2206
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,220
没事  我明白  没事的  我理解
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2207
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,720
虽然这么说
With that said...

2208
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,430
其实这案子是被扔在我桌上的
this case got dumped on my desk...

2209
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,350
-是这样吗  -你懂的  高层
- Did it? - You know, by a higher-up

2210
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,550
那些想要作秀的人
who needs to make a show

2211
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,650
得借着追查一家新公司为由
of looking into the new company on the block,

2212
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,190
-拉上一堆媒体之类的  -新上位那些
- with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.

2213
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,930
然后我就变成了来做调查的蠢货
And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking.

2214
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,860
就是这样
Exactly.

2215
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,860
只是  你懂的...这东西很烦
It's just, you know... it bothers me.

2216
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,580
我们是新人
We're the new guy.

2217
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,490
我们是去敲华尔街的门的人
We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2218
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,660
我的意思是  你应该...
I mean, you should...

2219
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,660
你应该去查查那些大投行在干什么
You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.

2220
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,200
我说  我知道所有的内幕
I mean, I know all the information.

2221
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,160
是真的  高盛  雷曼兄弟  美林
It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2222
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,160
{\an8}均为美国大投行

2223
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,250
担保债务凭证
Collateralized debt obligations?

2224
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,620
还有什么互联网概念股
This Internet stock bullshit?

2225
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,500
简直就是他妈的放屁
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2226
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,830
我能手把手地告诉你
I could take you step-by-step

2227
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,590
他们每一步都在做什么
through what exactly is occurring.

2228
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,430
你只需要开口问
All you have to do is ask.

2229
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,890
我随时恭候
I'm available.

2230
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,430
我就等你这句话了
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2231
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,390
我不明白像这样的谈话
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2232
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,810
怎么就不能对我们双方都有利了
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2233
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,910
本来就应该这样  是吧
It should. Right?

2234
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,190
这本来就该对我们双方都有利
It should profit the both of us.

2235
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,770
-是应该这样  -听着
- It should. - Look.

2236
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,520
我会给你我的私人号码
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2237
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:17,530
工作日里随时可以打电话给我
Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.

2238
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,450
-我会的  -棒极了
- I'll do that. - Great.

2239
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,700
你们确定不喝点什么
Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?

2240
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,450
你们不饿吗  什么也不要
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2241
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,160
-什么都不要吗  不要吗  -不用了
- Nothing? No? - Oh, no.

2242
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:31,190
让我问你几个问题
Let me ask you,

2243
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,880
假如你不想透露太多个人信息
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2244
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,250
你可以随时叫我闭嘴
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2245
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,760
你是不是曾经考虑过弄个经纪人执照
Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?

2246
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,760
我不知道自己有没有听错
Did I hear that right?

2247
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,680
你是不是也曾想来华尔街分一杯羹
Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2248
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,510
-没有吗  -你和谁谈过话
- No? - Who you been talking to?

2249
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,600
你他妈和谁谈过了
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2250
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,430
你在调查我  我也听了你的事迹
Well, you're investigating me. I hear things.

2251
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,600
你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

2252
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,270
你有没有想过假如你坚持下去了
You ever think about what would've happened

2253
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:54,810
会发生什么
if you would have stayed the course?

2254
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,070
你知道吗  每当我搭地铁回家
You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway

2255
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,400
蛋蛋都他妈汗湿了
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2256
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,280
一套西服连续穿了三天...
I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...

2257
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,860
没错  我当然想过
Yeah, you bet I do.

2258
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,620
我以前就想过这个  谁不想呢  是吧
I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?

2259
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,740
没错  谁他妈会不想呢
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2260
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:06,990
你是怎么...
What do you get...

2261
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,330
又是一个私人为题  你不用回答
Another personal question, no need to answer...

2262
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,790
没事  没关系的  乔丹
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2263
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,920
你能赚多少啊  五六万之类的
What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?

2264
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
一年吗  大约
A year? In the ballpark?

2265
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,590
我...
Well, I...

2266
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:18,460
这样说吧
Let's put it this way.

2267
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,340
局里至少能给你一把免费的枪
You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.

2268
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,220
这他妈让我很生气啊  你懂我意思吗
No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?

2269
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,470
你想想  那些建设了这个国家的人
You think about the people that built this country,

2270
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,970
像你一样勤勤恳恳的人
hardworking people like you.

2271
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,600
消防员  老师  联邦探员
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2272
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,340
结果到最后
End of the day,

2273
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:34,400
你们这群人在经济上被生吞活剥了
you guys get fucking skinned alive financially.

2274
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,360
这他妈让我太生气了
It fucking makes me angry.

2275
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,530
如今  关于华尔街和这个市场
Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,

2276
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,280
在我看来  我觉得
for me, I feel

2277
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,700
能回馈社会是好事  你知道  有些
it's good to give back. You know, there's...

2278
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,950
有些情况下我能
There are situations where I can

2279
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,580
让这些人处境好点  明白吗
make those situations better for people. You know?

2280
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,950
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

2281
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,460
机遇
Opportunity

2282
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,000
就是一切
is everything.

2283
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,330
太对了
Exactly.

2284
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,920
举个例子  有这么个小孩  是吧
Take for example, I got this one kid, right?

2285
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,800
去学校学环境科学之类的
Went to school for environmental science, something like that.

2286
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,680
但却被学生贷款困住了
He was bogged down by student loans.

2287
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,470
然后他妈又要做三重心脏搭桥手术
Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.

2288
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,970
-天呐  -没错  很惨
- Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.

2289
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,010
是啊
Sure.

2290
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,180
但是我们在正确的时候
But we got him into the market

2291
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,980
拉他入市  再选一只正确的股票
at the right time and chose the right stock.

2292
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,810
我们给予他正确的指导
We gave him the right guidance.

2293
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:18,060
轰  一夜之间  就改变了他整个人生
Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life.

2294
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,530
他妈被送进了纽约最好的医院
Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.

2295
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,770
但还是没用
It didn't work out for her,

2296
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,490
假设  她还是去世了  很不幸
granted, she passed away, unfortunately.

2297
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,490
但我们至少给了他那个机会
But we gave him that opportunity.

2298
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,740
你懂我在说什么吗
You know what I'm saying?

2299
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,760
这取决于建立一个好团队
It's just about setting up the right team,

2300
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,950
然后一夜之间你的人生将得以改变
and then overnight your life can change.

2301
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,750
一个实习生能...能...
What does... What does an intern...

2302
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,170
一个实习生做这样一单能赚多少
What does an intern make in a deal like that?

2303
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,300
在那种情况下
Well, in that situation,

2304
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,260
在那笔特定的交易里  就那一笔
in that particular trade, and it was one trade,

2305
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,100
五十多万美元吧
north of half a million dollars.

2306
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,980
而且我会为任何人做这件事  明白吗
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2307
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,730
任何需要适当的指导的人
anybody that needs the proper guidance.

2308
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,630
能再说一遍吗  就把刚刚说的再说一遍
Can you say that again, just the way you said it?

2309
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:27,760
一模一样的
Just the same way.

2310
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:33,060
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

2311
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,390
算了吧  你当然懂我在说什么
Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about.

2312
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,480
我觉得刚刚乔丹在干的事是...
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2313
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,690
-假如我没弄错的话...  -不是
- If I'm not mistaken... - No.

2314
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,900
你刚刚在试图贿赂一个联邦官员
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2315
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,070
没有  理论上我没有贿赂任何人
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2316
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:45,570
不不  我听到的可不是这样的  乔丹
No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2317
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,150
不不  根据美国刑法
No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,

2318
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,530
贿赂必须有个
there needs to be an exact

2319
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,660
确切的金额
dollar figure for the exchange of services.

2320
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,370
那个在法庭上站不住脚的
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2321
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,120
不不  我听见的可不是这么回事
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2322
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,620
不不不  事实就是如此
No, no, no, that's the truth.

2323
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,910
但我想告诉你这个
But I want to tell you this.

2324
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
你说
Yeah.

2325
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,580
那个告诉我你曾经试过
The same gentleman that told me

2326
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,420
考经纪人执照的人
that you tried to get your broker's license

2327
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,630
也和我说过你是个规矩正直的人
also told me that you are a straight arrow.

2328
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,210
他把我仔细调查了一番
He ran a security check on me.

2329
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,510
这个嘛...
Well...

2330
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,380
没错  假如你驾着一艘
Yeah, when you sail on a boat

2331
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,590
像是邦德电影里反派开的船
fit for a Bond villain,

2332
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,340
那有时你就得扮扮"恶人"   是吧
sometimes you need to play the part. Right?

2333
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,060
我觉得你俩是时候滚下我的船了
I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.

2334
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:16,430
你说什么
What do you say?

2335
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,770
你知道吗  乔丹  我告诉你一件事
You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something.

2336
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:21,850
大部分我逮捕的华尔街混蛋
Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,

2337
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:24,610
他们都是天生如此
they're to the manor born.

2338
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:25,770
-是吗  -没错
- Is that right? - Yeah.

2339
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,480
他们老爹是混蛋
Their fathers are douchebags,

2340
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,490
老爹的老爹也是
just like their fathers before them.

2341
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,030
但你不一样
But you...

2342
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,030
乔丹  你全是自己打拼出来的
You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.

2343
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,370
是吗
Did I?

2344
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:39,540
-佩服佩服  小伙子  -小伙子
- Good for you, little man. - Little man?

2345
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,910
真心佩服
Good for you.

2346
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,170
你居然叫我小伙子
Me, the little man?

2347
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,290
而且我跟你说
And let me tell you something.

2348
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,210
我跟你说点别的
Let me tell you something else.

2349
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,500
老实说  我没跟你开玩笑啊
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2350
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:48,800
这艘船可说是我登上过的
this is one of the nicest boats

2351
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
-最好的船了  真心话  -我看也是
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.

2352
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:52,380
你知道我还怎么想的吗
And you know what I was just thinking, too?

2353
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:55,760
如果哪天局里派人封了这艘船
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office

2354
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,060
那我他妈肯定就是大英雄
when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.

2355
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,350
你他妈说是不是这样  乔丹
Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2356
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,730
瞧瞧这艘船
look at this thing!

2357
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,150
多漂亮
It's beautiful!

2358
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,190
而且你船上还有美妞儿  多好
And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.

2359
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,730
挺好  快他妈给我滚
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2360
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,440
我想我们很快就会
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2361
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,570
-再见面的  -我同意
- real soon. - I'm sure.

2362
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:12,810
祝你们坐破地铁
Good luck on that subway

2363
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,120
回家干你们臭婆娘的路上一路顺风
ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2364
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,370
我则要让海蒂
I'm gonna have Heidi lick

2365
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:18,290
就着鱼子酱舔我的蛋
some caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2366
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:21,040
你两个想不想带些龙虾回家
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?

2367
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,750
一群混蛋  谅你们也吃不起
Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!

2368
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:25,920
一群贱货
Fucking cheap fucks.

2369
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,050
混蛋
Fucking miserable pricks.

2370
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,340
两位  看看我掏兜的时候找着了啥
Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!

2371
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,380
把你们一年的工资都掏出来了
A year's salary right here.

2372
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:36,140
你知道我管这叫什么吗  优惠券
You know what I call them? Fun coupons!

2373
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,470
看见了吗
See that!

2374
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,020
我都嫌多的优惠券
They're fun coupons!

2375
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,570
瑞士  瑞士有什么好逛的
Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2376
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,690
当然是去逛瑞士银行
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2377
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,450
现在得遮遮丑  我必须得把钱藏起来
It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.

2378
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,280
因特·鲁格拉特
Enter Rugrat.

2379
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,040
他是在法学院里认识这个瑞士银行家的
He knew this Swiss banker from law school.

2380
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,160
这是干欧洲娘们用的
That's for European pussy!

2381
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,500
但他人在日内瓦
But he was in Geneva.

2382
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,960
所以这趟长途飞机  我肯定要嗨着过去
And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.

2383
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,420
我知道我只需适当的药量
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2384
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,550
就能睡完整个旅程
I could sleep through the entire flight.

2385
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,300
但必须要按时按量
But I had to take them just right.

2386
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,970
下午四点整  我又吃了几片
At 4:00 P.M., I popped a few more ludes,

2387
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,510
这样等我开完销售会议
which started kicking in by the time

2388
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,350
药劲正好上来
I finished my sales meeting.

2389
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,810
这是手脚刺痒阶段
My tingle phase.

2390
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,810
到晚餐时  我再吃几片
By dinner, I popped a few more

2391
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,810
就着几杯鸡尾酒和一两片安定
on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.

2392
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,480
这是口齿不清阶段
My slur phase.

2393
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,980
到八点半  我再多吃几片
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2394
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,780
这时我差不多就走不动道了
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2395
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:36,530
这是口水横流阶段
This was the drool phase.

2396
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,950
到十点  我就完全不知道我是谁了
By 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was.

2397
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,620
这是记忆丧失阶段
The amnesia phase.

2398
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,500
我们在午夜之前登机
We boarded the plane just before midnight.

2399
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,290
妈呀  瞧瞧
Wow! Look at you!

2400
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,340
-好个美人儿  -请别这样  先生
- You're beautiful. - Excuse me, sir.

2401
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,710
他安眠药的药劲上来了  他没事的
His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right.

2402
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,340
能出示一下登机牌吗  先生
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2403
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,180
我们当然有登机牌
We have the boarding passes.

2404
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,300
向老天发誓  我真想干她
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2405
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,640
干嘛呢  轻点
Hey! Fucking relax.

2406
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,890
老天  快把你的爪子从我的老二上拿开
Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2407
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,350
别闹了
Cut it out.

2408
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,440
你看他还到处乱摸
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2409
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,520
我这是给你系安全带
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2410
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,810
你摸着他老二了吗
You got your hand on his dick?

2411
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,860
大庭广众的可控制着点啊
You gotta stop doing that in public places.

2412
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,900
我的天  放手
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2413
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,190
快放手
Take it off!

2414
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,990
我听说你头发里有藏宝图呢
I heard there's a treasure map under here.

2415

您这异域风情的口音我们听不懂
We don't understand this language you're speaking.

我要帮他系上安全带

Where are the ludes? Where are the ludes?

2458

你只要坐一坐就知道是什么感觉了
You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat.

2489
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,380
你需要大点的沙发  待客用的
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2490
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,170
哈哈  哈哈  我还是没懂  抱歉
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2491
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,090
我对你们国家的银行保密法很感兴趣
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here.

2492
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,890
等下  那个  抱歉乔丹
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2493
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,520
瑞士人待客总是得先来十分钟
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2494
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,650
这个那个的
Blah, blah, blah.

2495
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,360
-闲聊  -对就是闲聊  多谢
- Chit chat. - Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2496
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,070
然后再谈正事
...before business can be discussed.

2497
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,730
是吧
Yeah.

2498
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,570
那好
Of course.

2499
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,030
那咱们就说正事  您想了解些什么
Let's get down to it. What would you like to know?

2500
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,450
在什么情况下  你们有义务
Under what circumstances would you be obligated

2501
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,710
和联邦调查局
to cooperate with an FBI

2502
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,170
或者美国司法部之类的部门合作
or a U.S. Justice Department investigation, for example?

2503
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:00,960
看情况
Ca depend.

2504
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,710
还得看情况
Ca depend?

2505
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
没错
Oui.

2506
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,550
具体看什么情况
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2507
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,600
看美国人接下来几个月会不会
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland

2508
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,260
占领瑞士
in the coming months.

2509
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,930
要不要我去看看十字架上有没有跑坦克
Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2510
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:17,100
-那是十字街  -对对  十字街
- Yes. Rue de la Croix. - Croix. Croix.

2511
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,020
是街不是架  还"十字架"  是街啦
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2512
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,440
我们在法学院常玩这个来着  不信你看
See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.

2513
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,280
-是香槟还是香崩  -没错
- Champagne. Champagne. - Yeah.

2514
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,740
没错  还有炸薯条和炸洋芋
Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.

2515
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,030
-总之这类的  -逗出鸟来了
- And that kind of stuff. - That's funny.

2516
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:33,930
我问的是  你这瑞士废柴
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,

2517
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,500
你会不会事后坑我
is are you going to fuck me over?

2518
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,790
我当然听明白了  你个美国白痴
I understand perfectly, you American shit.

2519
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,340
外国司法部门能够获得
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve

2520
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,510
日内瓦银行合作的唯一情况
would cooperate with a foreign legal body

2521
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,760
就是他们指控的罪名在瑞士也同样违法
is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.

2522
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:58,440
但只有很少的瑞士法律涉及您从事的业务
But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.

2523
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,270
从金融角度讲
From a financial standpoint,

2524
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,440
您现在身处天堂了
you are now in heaven.

2525
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,480
我就说他很厉害吧
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2526
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,560
如果美国司法部
If the U.S. Justice

2527
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:11,780
发传票给我们  我们会只当它
Department sent us a subpoena, it would become

2528
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,870
是厕纸
papier toilette.

2529
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,000
擦屁股用的
We would wipe our ass with it.

2530
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,250
当然  除非他们是要调查
Unless, of course, it was an investigation

2531
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,170
股票诈骗
into stock fraud,

2532
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,420
我没记错的话  这在你们瑞士也是犯罪
which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2533
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:28,510
这样的话你们将有义务与他们合作
Then there would have to be cooperation on your part,

2534
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,590
-如果我没说错的话  -当然
- if I'm not mistaken. - Yes.

2535
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,180
当然会合作
Yes, we would.

2536
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,890
如果账户是在你名下的话
Assuming the account is under your name.

2537
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,140
但如果不是你的名字
If it were another name,

2538
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,980
是你的朋友  令亲之类的
a friend's, camarade...

2539
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,150
表亲吗
Cousin?

2540
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,230
表亲  肯定也行
Cousin, absolute.

2541
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,610
-你是说亲戚  -没错
- Relative? - Yeah.

2542
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,450
你刚才那是哼小调
Was that yodeling I just heard

2543
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,040
还是我所理解的那个意思
or did you just say what I thought you said?

2544
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,870
就是那个意思
Yes. Yes.

2545
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,170
他这是在建议我建个老鼠仓
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2546
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,040
但一只美国老鼠绝对没法
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2547
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:07,340
把那么多钱弄到瑞士来
into Switzerland with all that money.

2548
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,260
我还得找个有欧洲护照的老鼠
What I needed was a rathole with a European passport.

2549
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,980
乔丹
Jordan.

2550
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,940
你好啊  我最亲爱的姨妈
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2551
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,440
欢迎  路上没堵车吧
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2552
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,060
没有  当然没有
Oh, no, not at all.

2553
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,240
乔丹  快进来
Jordan, come in.

2554
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,900
还好说服艾玛姨妈没费多少劲
Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing.

2555
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,070
看来英国人跟瑞士人差别也没那么大嘛
Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss.

2556
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,740
只要钱跟上  一切就迎刃而解了
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2557
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,120
英式英语里"老鼠仓"怎么说
How do you say "Rathole" In British?

2558
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:44,000
一旦你碰上任何麻烦
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2559
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,840
我就会马上站出来  承认是我骗了你
I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you.

2560
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,210
我保证
That I promise.

2561
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,590
冒险尤其能让人倍感青春  是吧亲爱的
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling?

2562
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:57,720
有时我禁不住想
Sometimes I wonder

2563
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:01,020
你是不是让钱给拿住了  亲爱的
if you let money get the best of you, my love.

2564
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,270
以致忽视了其他种种
Among other substances.

2565
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,070
这么明显啊
It's that obvious, huh?

2566
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:13,400
天气一点都不热  但你却直冒汗
It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets.

2567
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,950
我该怎么说呢
What can I say? I'm...

2568
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,490
我是个瘾君子
I'm a drug addict.

2569
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:21,950
瘾头非常大
I really am.

2570
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,750
白粉  摇头丸
Cocaine, pills,

2571
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,670
这个那个  我都嗑
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2572
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,920
这是实情
Now that's the truth.

2573
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,250
我是说
I mean...

2574
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,710
我还有性瘾
I'm a sex addict, too.

2575
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:36,050
这世上肯定还有比性瘾更危险的事
Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

2576
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,720
天啊  我跟你说这些干什么  我干嘛
Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I...

2577
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,430
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

2578
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,390
因为我是个很好说话的人
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2579
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:47,480
还真是  你的确很好说话
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2580
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:50,070
在我看来
I suppose it's...

2581
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,570
这是我的责任
Just my job, you know.

2582
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,780
有这么多人依仗着我
All these people dependent on me.

2583
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:57,570
事关数以千万计的美金  你懂的
Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know.

2584
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,370
但有时我又觉得
Sometimes I feel like I...

2585
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,620
我有点贪多嚼不烂了
I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know.

2586
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,120
但你的胃口很大
You're a man with large appetites.

2587
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:06,370
是啊
Yeah.

2588
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,000
这姐们是在挑逗我吗
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2589
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:11,380
是啊
Yeah.

2590
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,800
还真是这样
Yeah, I am.

2591
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:18,510
看来是我自作自受了哈
I suppose I put that on myself though, right?

2592
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,390
我自己的决定
My decision.

2593
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:22,350
有时候很难
It's just hard to...

2594
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:26,350
很难控制内心的焦虑  你懂吗
Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2595
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,480
就是那个
You know, to...

2596
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:31,360
试着放松  放下心事
learn to relax and let go and...

2597
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,360
去释放压力吗
to release the tension.

2598
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,860
她还真在挑逗我
She is hitting on me.

2599
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,240
我的天啊
Holy shit!

2600
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,780
没错  释放压力
Yeah, to release the tension.

2601
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:47,370
看来我们都得
I suppose we...

2602
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,250
都得试着做到
We all just need to learn...

2603
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,170
顺其自然  对吧
learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?

2604
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:58,550
这哥们他妈是不是在挑逗我
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2605
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,430
稳住  亲爱的
Stability, dear.

2606
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,930
我们是亲戚
Family.

2607
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,730
你照顾好我的侄女  亲爱的
You take care of my niece, my love.

2608
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:19,360
这边放心交给我
I'll take care of everything over here.

2609
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,410
成交
Deal.

2610
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,120
爽  真他妈爽
Come on! There you go.

2611
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,420
我们货真价实地干了千金一炮
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2612
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,920
艾玛自己可运不了这么多钱
Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself.

2613
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:38,420
我就琢磨  还有谁有欧洲护照
So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport?

2614
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:40,510
布拉德  你捆得太紧了
Brad, you're making this too fucking tight!

2615
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,390
而布拉德作为一个成功的药贩子
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2616
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,680
每年冬天都要在法国南部度假
spent his winters in the south of France,

2617
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,810
在那里他遇见了他的妻子  仙黛尔
which is where he met his wife, Chantalle,

2618
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:50,770
她本是斯洛文尼亚的脱衣舞女
a stripper of Slovenian origin

2619
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,350
正好就出生在
born, in of all places,

2620
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,440
瑞士
Switzerland.

2621
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:00,280
这根本就成不了
Well, this is fucked.

2622
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:02,780
成了才怪
No shit.

2623
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,750
她怎么着得跑50趟吧
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2624
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:10,040
我知道
I know.

2625
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,960
不如这么着吧
Let me ask you something?

2626
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,670
她不是还有家人吗
What about her family? Right?

2627
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,420
他们人人都有瑞士护照
I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right.

2628
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,380
她有父母  有兄弟  是不是
She's got parents, she's got a brother, right?

2629
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,390
他兄弟还有个老婆  这就是五个人了
The brother's got a wife. That's five fucking people.

2630
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:26,390
顶多六七趟  是吧
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2631
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:28,060
他们跟她一样都是瑞士的蠢货
They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.

2632
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,390
-他们会同意的  -没准能行
- They'll do it. - We could do that.

2633
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,940
至少我还有家人  你个大鼻子蠢货
At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck!

2634
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,850
别忘了我的钱
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2635
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,730
抱歉你说啥
I'm sorry, what's that?

2636
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,280
我忘了提了  他也有
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He's got some...

2637

因为你屁都没跟我吭一声

"答录机上有留言吗"

我又不是傻的  你知道吗
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2720
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,640
你不能这样对别人
That's not how you treat people.

2721
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,760
你这张嘴太欠扇了
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2722

那操蛋村的村长今天不在
Hey, what are the citizens of Fucksville doing today

2729
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,490
操蛋村村民都干嘛呢
when their Emperor's gone?

2730
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:12,110
在暴乱吗
Is it mayhem?

2778
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,300
我认识的一个退休药剂师
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2779
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,550
把它在保险箱放了15年了
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2780
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,100
你他妈逗我呢  柠檬片
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2781
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,220
这能把咱们的脑袋都爽翻天
They're gonna knock us on our fucking heads.

2782
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:07,230
柠檬714就是安眠药中的战斗机
When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2783
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:08,810
-你敢相信吗  -我的老天
- Can you believe it? - Oh, my God.

2784
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,360
我以为这只是一个神话
I thought they were like a myth.

2785
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,320
这药比当今市面上的任何一种都要强三倍
Three times as powerful as anything available today.

2786
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,440
看看这些宝贝
Look at these babies.

2787
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:16,110
唐尼真是懂得怎么庆祝啊
Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2788
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,280
他说这个要留在特别时机再用
He said he was saving these for a special occasion.

2789
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,950
比如过生日  击掌庆祝时
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2790
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:24,000
亦或是咱的钱安全抵达瑞士
or our money arriving safely in Switzerland.

2791
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,670
于是当晚
So that night,

2792
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:30,590
我撇开所有计划并清除我体内
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2793
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:33,170
任何会影响我爽的东西
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2794
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,670
这是欢庆时刻
It was celebration time.

2795
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,430
来吧
Okay.

2796
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,010
先来一颗  看看怎么样
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2797
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,850
我的药头说只能吃一颗
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2798
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,350
给你
Here you go.

2799
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,720
-干杯  -干杯
- Salud! - Cheers.

2800
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:47,600
说不定我再拉一下就会下去了
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2801
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:50,610
史蒂夫  史蒂夫
Steve! Steve!

2802
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:51,940
我要离开这儿
I gotta get out of here!

2803
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,900
卡尔  我搞明白了
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2804
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:57,700
这个肯定是拉一下朝上拉两下朝下
It must be one pull for up and two pulls for down.

2805
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,030
好吧
Okay.

2806
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:09,170
有感觉吗
Do you feel anything?

2807
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,000
没有
No.

2808
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:17,550
都35分钟了
It's been 35 minutes.

2809
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:23,600
可能我们磕了这么多年有耐药性了
Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh?

2810
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,150
屁用没有
This is bullshit!

2811
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,410
我的新陈代谢飞速运转  啥感觉也没有
My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit!

2812
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,660
时间太长了
They're old.

2813
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,910
是不是过期了
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2814
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:46,620
看下瓶子
Check the bottle!

2815
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,870
81年1月
January '81.

2816
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,040

They're fucking duds.

2817
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,170

在布鲁克维尔乡村俱乐部

德纳姆  那个FBI探员

你没有要贿赂这个FBI探员吧

柠檬片产生了延迟效果

The cerebral palsy phase.

2887
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,090

你可不能恨两百万  唐尼
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2925
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,430
奇迹般地  我活着回到了家
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2926
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,810
我和车都没有蹭到

你吃什么了
What did you take?

2930
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,370
你有毛病啊你
What's wrong with you?

02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,450

放下电话
Get off the phone!

2935
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,760
你搞什么  乔丹

你女儿在家呢
Your daughter's in the house!

02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,010
他妈的你女儿在家呢
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2939
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:03,850
太他妈好玩了  唐尼

02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:06,480
放下电话

布拉德

你个吸鸡巴的
You fucking cocksucker!

2955
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:55,610
你都干了些什么好事
What did you do,

2956
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:57,480
你个垃圾
you piece of shit?

2957
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,990
操你妈
Fuck you!

2958
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:04,780
我他妈宰了你
I wanna fucking kill you!

抓住你了
I got you!

2960
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,560

我操
Oh, shit!

2962
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,230
乔丹  乔丹  你还好吗

2963
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,980
唐尼  唐尼
Donnie? Donnie?

2964
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,400
唐尼
Donnie?

2965
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:41,820
乔丹  他上不来气了
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2966
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,700
哦操  我不知道该怎么办
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2967
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,030
乔丹  我不知道该怎么办
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2968
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,450
我帮不了他了  我的天  乔丹
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2969
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:51,040
天呐  他呛住了  乔丹  快来帮忙
Oh, my God, I think he's choking, Jordan. Do something.

2970
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,870
-天啊  -宝贝  我来了
- Oh, God. - Baby, I got you!

2971
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:56,340
他没气了  乔丹  你快来帮忙啊
He's not breathing, Jordan. You gotta do something!

2972
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:59,550
操  天啊  我的天啊
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2973
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,800
我来了
I got you.

2974
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:23,740
靠边站
Step aside!

2975
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:27,280
老天啊
Oh, God!

2976
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,410
靠边站  宝贝
Move aside, baby.

2977
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,170
快点  快点
Come on! Come on!

2978
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,460
来啊
Come on!

2979
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,680
乔丹  他没呼吸了  快想点办法啊
Jordan, he's not breathing. You gotta do something.

2980
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,760
乔丹  他还有家有孩子呢
Jordan, he's a father! He's got fucking kids!

2981
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,520
-快想点办法  -好
- Do something! - Yeah?

2982
02:06:57,190 --> 02:06:58,270
罗科  快过来
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2983
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,270
-来啊  -快叫救护车
- Come on. - Call an ambulance!

2984
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,530
我他妈也不知道
I don't fucking know!

2985
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,360
赶快过来报警
Just get over here! Call 911.

2986
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,290
你还好吧  他没事了
You all right? He's all right.

2987
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:33,970
贝尔福先生
Mr. Belfort?

2988
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,560
滚出去  滚
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2989
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:42,150
先生  我们需要问你几个问题
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2990
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:44,780
你他妈开玩笑吧  去你妈
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2991
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,990
来吧  站起来
Come on, get up.

2992
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:47,610
滚出我的房子
Get the fuck out of my house.

2993
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,120
-走吧  -我整晚都在这儿
- Let's go. - I've been here all night.

2994
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,700
整晚都坐在这儿
I been sitting here all night.

2995
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,160
你们他妈什么意思
What the fuck are you talking about?

2996
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,200
-你们带他去哪儿  -你们带我去哪儿
- Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?

2997
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:57,370
你们带他去哪儿
Where you taking him?

2998
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:58,500
你们又没有搜查证
You ain't got no warrant.

2999
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,880
怎么能随便到别人家里来
Just come up in people's house like that!

3000
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,340
你今晚开过你的车吗  贝尔福先生
Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?

3001
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,960
怎么说呢
Well?

3002
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:12,720
看来我并没有安然无恙地到家
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

3003
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,240
快他妈让开
Get out of the fucking way!

3004
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,450
我擦
Fuck!

3005
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:42,710
你今晚开过这辆车吗
Did you drive that car tonight?

3006
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,960
-有  -好的
- Yeah. - Yeah, right.

3007
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,840
我可是有家室的
I'm a family man!

3008
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,670
有家室的  亲爱的
Family man. Honey!

3009
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,720
我没把自己撞死
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

3010
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,810
或者撞死别人真是个奇迹
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

3011
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:58,060
警察带我去问了话  但他们没法起诉我
The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.

3012
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:00,560
他们没法证明我开了车
They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.

3013
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,730
与此同时
Meanwhile,

3014
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:03,900
布拉德因为蔑视法庭坐了三个月牢
Brad did three months in jail for contempt,

3015
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,570
因为他不肯供出唐尼
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

3016
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:09,360
结果就是  我安然无恙
The result, I was scot-free.

3017
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,820
但我也受到了前所未有的监视
But I had eyes on me like never before.

3018
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,570
你真是走运  乔丹
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3019
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:16,580
居然能活着  还不用坐牢
You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail.

3020
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,250
你知道我不相信运气的  对吧
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

3021
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,660
但是是时候了
But it's time.

3022
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,000
拜托让我跟证监会谈好条件
Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal

3023
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,000
在你运气用光以前
before your luck runs out.

3024
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,670
跟爸爸挥挥手
Wave to Daddy.

3025
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,840
嗨
Hey.

3026
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,420
你好啊  甜心
Hey, sweetie.

3027
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:36,930
都有什么条件  如果我...
What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...

3028
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,220
这很难说
I don't know.

3029
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:41,270
你得坦白一些违反证券规则
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,

3030
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,400
操纵股价  高压销售
stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics.

3031
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:47,270
都是这样的小罪  你懂的
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

3032
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,320
你得付几百万的罚款
You pay a couple million dollars in fines,

3033
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:52,360
作为交换  证监会永远不会再烦你
in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time.

3034
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:56,320
那斯特拉顿呢
And Stratton?

3035
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,700
斯特拉顿会怎么样
What happens to Stratton?

3036
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:01,620
没别的办法...你必须收手  对吧
There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?

3037
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:02,830
让唐尼管事就行
Let Donnie be in charge.

3038
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,540
没错  唐尼
Right. Donnie.

3039
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:07,420
FBI可没那么好对付
Now the FBI is another animal completely.

3040
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,300
他们会继续追查你的犯罪行为
They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.

3041
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:12,130
不过  只要你自愿离职
However, with you stepping down voluntarily,

3042
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,130
我猜你的好朋友德纳姆探员
my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham

3043
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:16,550
也就无计可施了
will be standing around with his dick in his hand.

3044
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,970
乔丹
Jordan.

3045
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,970
你还有什么好考虑的
What do you have to think about?

3046
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,640
你打败了他们
You beat them.

3047
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:23,850
你赢了
You won!

3048
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:25,560
你一辈子都不用工作了
God knows you never have to work again.

3049
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:27,650
你还想怎么样  在牢里度过余生吗
What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3050
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:28,820
-你想那样吗  -不想
- Is that what you want? - No.

3051
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:29,940
-当然不想  -那不就得了
- Of course not. - Okay.

3052
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,070
你已经挣了全世界的财富
Okay! You got all the money in the world.

3053
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,740
难道还想把所有人的钱都挣光吗
You need everybody else's money?

3054
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,240
-当然不是  爸  -所以啊
- Of course not, Pops. - Well?

3055
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,660
-可这是我一手创造的  -这我知道
- You know, I built it. - I know you built it.

3056
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,450
你创造了这些  现在你得保住它们
You built it, so now preserve it.

3057
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:12,110
你知道
You know,

3058
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,200
五年前  当我和唐尼·亚速一起创立
five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont

3059
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,360
斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的时候  我就知道
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3060
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,740
总有一天我要离开这里
would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.

3061
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:26,500
现在我非常沉重地宣布...
And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...

3062
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,290
那一天终于来了
That that day is finally here.

3063
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:36,800
我想...我想谢谢你们所有人
I wanna... I want to thank you all for your...

3064
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,550
谢谢你们多年的忠诚与敬仰
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

3065
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,100
但重点是
But the point is this.

3066
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,310
在唐尼的领导下
Under Donnie's leadership,

3067
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:46,850
再加上尼基·克斯考夫和罗比·范伯格
along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg

3068
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:48,530
加入领导层
moving into key management positions,

3069
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:51,150
这里只会比原来更好
this place really, is gonna be better than ever!

3070
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:53,360
我保证  好吗
That I promise you. Okay?

3071
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:56,240
为他们鼓掌吧  来吧
Give them a round of applause. Come on.

3072
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:02,080
这里就是埃利斯岛  各位
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3073
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,830
我不管你是谁  从哪里来
I don't care who you are, where you're from,

3074
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:06,410
不管你的祖先是坐他妈的五月花号

3091
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,840
我遇到的几米可不是这样的
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3092

我遇到的几米身无分文
The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.

真是讽刺啊
It's a shame, you know.

3117

这么多年来  我一直告诉你们
For years, I've been telling

3118

不要接受别人的拒绝  对吧

继续努力  不要挂下电话
You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone

3120
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,650
知道你得到你想要的

这他妈算什么啊
What the fuck is that, you know?

3127
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,050
我来告诉你它是什么  它是...
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3128
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:08,600
是我接受别人的拒绝
It's me taking no for an answer, you know.

3129
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:11,350
是他们...
It's them...

3130
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:14,680
他们说服了我  而不是反过来

3131
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,150
是我变成了伪君子
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

这是我的家

3139

他们得拆了这地方
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball

3140
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:05,400
才能把我弄走
to take me out of here!

3141

让他们派国民警卫队来吧

正好布拉德也出狱了

但他拒绝了  说他不干了

3158

他不想再跟我们有瓜葛

他们倒也没什么共同点  不过...

算了  我也不知道怎么会想到这些的

没过几天  传票就开始满天飞

Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

我血压低  甲状腺的问题

跟这里的好几名员工谈过了

3204
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,040
没人记得史蒂夫·麦登首次公开募股的事

02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,370
我觉得挺奇怪的
I think it's odd.

3206
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:50,750

不  我完全不记得

抱歉  我想问你的头发是真的吗

你想谈这个吗
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3211
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,510
要对我的头发品头论足吗
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3212
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,310
我们是来谈这些...谈私人问题的吗

我只是好奇你的发型

所以我们带着老婆去了意大利
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3220
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:25,750
我们觉得在海外办公会更安全
We figured we were safer working from overseas

3221
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:27,210
只要给鲁格拉特下命令就好
giving orders to Rugrat.

3222
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:29,460
没人能逮捕我们  也没人能证明
Nobody could arrest us and nobody could prove

3223
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:31,540
我在游艇上操控着斯特拉顿
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3224
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:32,880
嘿  鲁格拉特
Hey, Rugrat.

3225
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,130
你好啊
Bonjour.

3226
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:36,210
你这秃头鹰  还好吗
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3227
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:37,260
唐尼  唐尼  听着
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3228
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,630
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem, okay.

3229
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,970
你的朋友史蒂夫·麦登正在抛售股份
Your friend, Steve Madden, is unloading shares.

3230
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,100
你说什么呢  谁告诉你的
What are you saying? Who told you that?

3231
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:45,770
-怎么了  -是真的  唐尼
- What's going on? - He's doing it, Donnie!

3232
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:48,310
他说史蒂夫·麦登在抛售股份
He said that Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3233
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:49,520
谁跟你说的  真是胡扯
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3234
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:51,940
快把电话给我
Give me that goddamn phone.

3235
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,560
-怎么了  -别听他的...
- What's going on? - Don't listen...

3236
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:55,860
乔丹  听着  我正盯着屏幕呢
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3237
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,650
有大量的史蒂夫·麦登股票被抛售
and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay.

3238
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:00,780
不是我们卖的  所以只能是史蒂夫
It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve.

3239
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:02,910
只有他有那么多股份
He's the only person with that many shares.

3240
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:03,950
我是唐尼  打给我  好吗
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3241
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:06,370
唐尼  你的小朋友想害我  你知道吗
Donnie, your little friend is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3242
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,200
你的小朋友想害死我
Your little friend is trying to fuck me right in the ass.

3243
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:09,870
-现在就给他打电话  -我们还不确定
- Get him on the phone now! - We don't know anything yet.

3244
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,330
别急着下结论
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3245
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:13,540
尽管我掌握了百分之八十五的
Even though I owned 85%

3246
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:16,670
史蒂夫·操蛋·混球·麦登鞋业的股份
of Steve-cocksucking- motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3247
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,010
但股权都是在他名下的
the shares were in his fucking name.

3248
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:21,300
这混蛋知道调查局在找我麻烦
This motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the feds

3249
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,180
想要趁火打劫
and was trying to take advantage.

3250
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:24,760
说话啊  你准备怎么办
Talk to me, man. How do you wanna play this?

3251
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:26,600
我要你现在就打给所有的客户
I want you to get all our clients on the phone right now,

3252
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:27,970
让他们开始卖史蒂夫·麦登的股票
and have them start selling Steve Madden.

3253
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:29,520
我们得把他妈的股价降下来
We're gonna drive that fucking price down!

3254
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,100
听到了吗  你他妈闭嘴
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3255
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:32,850
他是你的高中同学
This is your fucking friend from high school.

3256
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:35,110
要是那个小混球想弄我
If that little fucking prick thinks he can fuck with me,

3257
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:37,780
我们就把他的公司弄成低价股  懂了吗
we'll turn his company into a penny stock! You hear me?

3258
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,280
-听到了吗  -听到了
- You got it? - Yes. I got it!

3259
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,350
在了解情况之前
Let's just not jump to

3260
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,280
先别急着下结论
conclusions before we know what's going on.

3261
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,910
泰德船长
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:47,790
把电话挂了  所有人
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,620
掉头  我们回家
Turn the boat around! We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,130
宝贝  宝贝  怎么了
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,670
我...
I just...

3266
02:21:58,090 --> 02:21:59,340
亲爱的  出什么事了
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,090
艾玛姑姑
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:04,260
等一下
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:06,300
我不行
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,390 --> 02:22:09,270
怎么了  你怎么哭了
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:11,390
-她死了  -谁  谁死了
- She's dead! - Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,850
我刚接到贝蒂表姐的电话
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,020
然后呢
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,810
艾玛姑姑死了
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:20,940
-你他妈在开玩笑吧  -没有
- Are you fucking kidding me? - No.

3276
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:22,450
你认真的吗
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,530
天啊  宝贝  这真是...
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,070
我操
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:28,950
亲爱的  真是...
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,370
去你妹的心脏病
Fucking heart attack!

3281
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:32,040
砰  啪  嗝屁
Boom, snap, gone.

3282
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,960
从此远离尘世
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

3283
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,380
我的两千万困在瑞士的银行账户里了
And $20 million stuck in a Swiss bank account.

3284
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:39,550
上次见到她  她还好好的呢
The last time I talked to her she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:41,800
-她也没那么老  -天啊  宝贝
- She's not that old. - Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:44,050
太他妈糟糕了
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:45,840
我操
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,930
真是糟糕
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:49,560
你姨妈是个端庄美丽的女人
Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman.

3290
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:51,560
请接收我对你和你家人的慰问
My condolences to you and your family.

3291
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:52,980

Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3292
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:55,060
谢谢你的慰问
Thank you so much for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:58,060
那她的账户要怎么处理
Now where does that leave us in regard to her account exactly?

3294
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,650
是要被审查还是怎样
Does it go into probate or what?

3295
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:01,320
这个你不需要担心  乔丹
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3296
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,070
你姑姑在死之前
Your aunt, before she died,

3297
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:06,070
签了份文件  任命你为继承人
signed a document naming you as her successor.

3298
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,820
真的吗
She did?

3299
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:09,530
太好了  这是个好消息
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3300
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:11,990
这个嘛  暂时还不是
Well, not as of yet.

3301
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:14,330
什么叫做暂时还不是
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3302
02:23:16,750 --> 02:23:18,460
我听不清你说什么
I can't seem to hear you.

3303
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,250
这里的信号太差了  你在说英文吗
I must have bad reception. Are you speaking English?

3304
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,090
-快  现在  快动身  -快
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast. - Fast?

3305
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:26,300
我要现在就动身去瑞士吗
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3306
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:30,100
说英语  给老子说英语
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3307
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:31,470
安静点  让我讲完
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3308
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:34,380
带上西装  带上小鸡鸡  给我滚过来
Take your suit, take your dick, okay, and move your ass! Please.

3309
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:36,890
好的  我立刻过去
Okay. Move my ass! Yes!

3310
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:41,110
我得说  这些瑞士人真够狡猾
I gotta say, these Swiss were some sneaky motherfuckers.

3311
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:43,110
就在几分钟内  他找到了一个
Within minutes, he had me set up with a forger

3312
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:45,190
可以伪造艾玛姑姑签名的人
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3313
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:46,820
你个美国废物
You American shit!

3314
02:23:46,990 --> 02:23:50,370
我必须明天前到那里  否则损失两千万
I just had to get there by tomorrow, or lose $20 million.

3315
02:23:50,450 --> 02:23:52,160
我们要去摩纳哥
We're going to Monaco!

3316
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:55,000
-摩纳哥  现在吗  -是的  宝贝
- Monaco? Now? - Yes, baby.

3317
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,670
我们先去摩纳哥  然后去瑞士
We're going to Monaco, so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3318
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:59,460
-但是她的姑姑刚去世  -我知道
- But her aunt just died. - I realize that.

3319
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,940
但我要去瑞士办事
But I have business in Switzerland.

3320
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:02,460
我必须现在就去瑞士
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3321
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:04,630
就这样定了  抱歉
Bottom line. Sorry.

3322
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,720
我们要赶去伦敦
We gotta get to London.

3323
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:08,470
为什么  为什么
Why? Why?

3324
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:11,140
要参加葬礼啊
The funeral!

3325
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:12,560
宝贝  你听我说

3326
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:15,810
我是这世上最爱你姑姑的人
I loved your aunt more than anyone in the entire world.

3327
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,390
我真的很爱她
I really did.

3328
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:20,150
但她死了  宝贝
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3329
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:22,440
她死了  哪都不能去
She's dead and she's not going anywhere.

3330
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,900
等我们去到伦敦  她依然是死的
She'll still be dead by the time we get to London, okay?

3331
02:24:25,570 --> 02:24:27,320
泰德船长  听好了
Captain Ted! Captain Ted, all right, look.

3332
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:29,200
我们现在改去摩纳哥  知道吗
We're going to Monaco. Monaco now, okay?

3333
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,320
摩纳哥  好的
Monaco, right.

3334
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:32,280
我们先去摩纳哥  然后再转去瑞士
We're going to Monaco so that we can drive to Switzerland

3335
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,660
就能免去那些出入境手续了
so they don't stamp our passports.

3336
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:35,620
办完事后  我们再开回摩纳哥
Take care of business here, we'll drive back to Monaco,

3337
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:37,370
坐飞机到伦敦  参加葬礼
take a flight over to London to catch the funeral

3338
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,960
三个办事日后回到纽约
and be in New York in three fucking business days!

3339
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:40,210
这就是计划
That's the fucking plan.

3340
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:42,670
我们可能会遇到海上风暴
I just want you to know that we might run into some chop.

3341
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,960
小小的风暴  我们能搞定的吧
Chop? We can fucking handle chop, right?

3342
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,460
我们的游艇足足有170英尺长
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3343
02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:47,580
不不不  我们哪儿也不去
No, no, no. We're not going

3344
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:49,300
除非他说安全
anywhere unless he says it's safe, all right.

3345
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,800
-别担心风暴  -那很安全
- Don't worry about the chop. - It's safe.

3346
02:24:50,890 --> 02:24:52,220
你压根就不懂什么是风暴
You don't know shit about chop.

3347
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:54,510
就你懂  你什么时候成风暴专家了
Oh, really? And you do? You're a fucking expert on that.

3348
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,930
要不我把你的信用卡额度减半  怎么样
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that?

3349
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:58,890
小小的风暴没事的  相信我
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3350
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:00,690
不用担心风暴  对吧泰德船长
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3351
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:03,860
如果我们开慢点的话  就不用怕了
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3352
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:05,110
对的  我们开慢点就好了
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3353
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:06,780
就是有点不舒适罢了  安全的
It's a little uncomfortable. Tell them it's safe.

3354
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,030
还是安全的
It's gonna be safe.

3355
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:11,700
我们把舱口封了  确保夹板安全
We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck.

3356
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:15,490
可能会打碎几个碟子
And we're looking at a few... maybe a few broken dishes.

3357
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,700
就打碎几个碟子
Few broken dishes.

3358
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:18,000
打碎几个碟子是什么概念
What's a few broken dishes?

3359
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,370
听起来很安全嘛  不会有事的
Does that sound fucking awesome or what?

3360
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,830
才不是
No. Not really.

3361
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,210
我们一定会玩得很开心的
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3362
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,040
让我们现在就出发去摩纳哥

摩托艇翻倒在甲板上了

02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,940
大风警报  大风警报
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3369
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:47,820
海浪已升至20英尺高  并持续上升
The waves are 20 feet high and building!

3370
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,570

Turn around, let's go the other fucking way.

3371
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,860
-不行  -掉头
- We can't! - Go!

3372
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:53,530
现在掉头的话  会翻船的
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3373
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,410
我是个潜水大师  你听到吗
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3374
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:56,530
我是个潜水大师
I'm a master diver!

3375
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,870
没有人会死
No one's gonna fucking die!

3390
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,110
你说什么
What are you saying?

3391
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:29,020
该死的

3392
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,110
去把安眠酮拿来

3393
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:32,780

I can't go down there, Jordan. It's flooded.

3394

下面的水有三尺深
It's three feet of water down there!

3395

我不要清醒得死去
I will not die sober!

02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,780
把那些该死的安眠酮拿来
Get those fucking ludes!

3397
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:39,910
好的
Okay!

3398
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,330
-快去  -好的

3399
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:45,960
-他要去哪里  -抓紧  宝贝

3400
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,630
唐尼  他疯了吗
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3401
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,840
他只是去警告其他人
He's just warning everybody!

3402
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,770
天啊
Jesus Christ!

3403

抓紧了
Hold on!

3415
02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:28,500
小心
Watch out!

3416
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,720
被意大利人救起来的好处就是
The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians

3417
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:46,560
他们会喂饱你  给你喝红酒
is that they feed you, make you drink red wine,

3418
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,600
最后还会跟你跳舞
then you get to dance.

3419
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,870
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

3420
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:10,210
那架飞机是我叫来接我们的
That was the plane I sent to come get us.

3421
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:14,880
你一定想不到  一只海鸥撞上了机翼
I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine.

3422
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,970
飞机在空中爆炸  死了三个人
Three people killed.

3423
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,970
你希望上帝给你指引吗
You want a sign from God?

3424
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:26,140
这次之后  我终于得到了指引
Well, after all this, I finally got the message.

3425
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:35,230
你梦想过财政独立
Do you dream of becoming financially independent

3426
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,990
却每个月都有还不完的债吗
but struggle every month just to pay your bills?

3427
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:40,110
你想要拥有这样一栋房子
Would you like to own a home like this,

3428
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,160
却只能勉强付得起房租吗
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3429
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,680
我是乔丹·贝尔福
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3430
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,950
创造财富  并没有什么秘密
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3431
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:48,540
无论你是谁  来自哪里
No matter who you are, no matter where you came from,

3432
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:51,210
都可以在几个月内
you too can become financially independent

3433
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:53,040
实现财政独立
in just a matter of months.

3434
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:55,250
你需要的是一套策略
All you need is a strategy.

3435
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,960
在我24岁那年
When I was 24 years old,

3436
02:28:57,050 --> 02:29:00,880
我做了个决定  我不仅要生存还要发达
I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive.

3437
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:03,430
一开始  我没想过这一切会成真
At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible.

3438
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:06,930
但我们现在有了房子  还挣了三万三
But we have the house and we have a $33,000 profit.

3439
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,140
我现在相信了
I certainly believe now.

3440
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,640
好好想想
Think about it for a second.

3441
02:29:09,730 --> 02:29:11,850
如果你没勇气拨打乔丹·贝尔福热线
If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's

3442
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:14,110
参加他们的研讨会
Straight Line Persuasion System Seminar,

3443
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:15,770
又怎么可能创造财富呢
then how do you expect to make any money?

3444
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:17,940
如果你想成为百万富翁
If you want to be a millionaire someday,

3445
02:29:17,950 --> 02:29:19,610
鼓起勇气  做个决定吧
have some guts. Make a decision.

3446
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:20,630
乔丹·贝尔福的方案很适合我
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me

3447
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:22,450
因为我很努力工作
because I worked hard for it.

3448
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,080
如果对你不起作用  那就证明你太懒了
And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy.

3449
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:26,790
你只配在麦当劳工作
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3450
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:29,290
没有人能在财政独立上拖你后腿
There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom.

3451
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:32,290
也没有人能阻止你挣大钱
And there's nobody stopping you from making millions.

3452
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,630
坐在家里  无所事事
Don't just sit at home,

3453
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:36,340
只会让你想要的生活与你失之交臂
or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.

3454
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:42,720
我改变了这些人的命运  也能改变你的
I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours, too!

3455
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,050
来参加我的研讨会吧
So come to my seminar!

3456
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:45,510

02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,310
好久不见  乔丹
Good to see you again, Jordan.

开什么玩笑
You gotta be joking!

3460
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,650
你别开玩笑了
You're kidding me.

3461
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,310
放开我
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3462
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,650
把摄像机关了
Turn that camera off.

3463
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:57,730
我他妈在拍宣传片呢
I'm fucking shooting a fucking infomercial here,

3464
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,190
你们这群混球
you fucking cocksucker!

3465
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,990
-去你的  你个混球  -关掉摄像机
- Fuck you, you motherfucker! - Shut the fucking camera off.

3466
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:02,820
别碰我  听到了吗
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3467
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:03,990
都给我滚
Go fuck yourself!

3468
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:06,450
我挣的都是老实钱  你们这群混球
I'm making an honest living, you fucking piece of shit!

3469
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:09,500
乔丹  让我给你点法律建议
Hey, Jordan, let me give you a little legal advice.

3470
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:11,000
给我闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

3471
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:12,620
去你的  你个混球
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3472
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:15,250
我挣的都是老实钱  你们这群混球
I'm making an honest living, you motherfucker!

3473
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:21,170
我改过自新  成了电视名人
I clean up my act. I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3474
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:24,010
两年滴酒不沾了  却发生这事
I'm sober for two years. And this happens!

3475
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,300
鲁格拉特在迈阿密被逮捕了
Rugrat goes and gets busted down in Miami.

3476
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:27,640
我是瑞士人  不是共和党人
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3477
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,390
猜猜谁也被捕了  索雷尔
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3478
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:30,520
-你要揍我吗  -不  先生
- You gonna beat me? - No, sir.

3479
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,850
我了解你们国家  你们会揍我的
Yeah, I know your country. You're gonna beat me.

3480
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,690
这是什么鬼几率
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3481
02:30:34,770 --> 02:30:37,400
日内瓦有上万个瑞士银行家
There had to be 10,000 Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3482
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:38,960
鲁格拉特就找了一个
and Rugrat gets the one dumb

3483
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,280
让自己在美国本土上被逮捕的笨蛋

很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

3486
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,660
更扯淡的是
Even more fucked was that

3487
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:50,870
他被逮捕  跟我一点关系都没有

3488
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:52,540
跟我没有半毛钱关系
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3489
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,580
说是一起通过海外龙舟赛

为什么啊  老天爷
Why, why, God?

3497
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:09,390
你为什么那么残忍
Why would you be so cruel

3498
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:12,060
要我和一家铁板烧连锁餐厅
as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

3499
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,390
一起倒台

02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:18,270
长话短说  索雷尔把我供了出来
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3501
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:21,480

But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3502
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,180

她每次去瑞士  都要跟他通奸

3504
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,160
-不不不  这不可能  -是的是的
- No, no, no, it's impossible. - Oui, oui, oui.

3505
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:34,160

02:31:46,010 --> 02:31:48,390
一起妨碍司法罪
One count obstruction of justice.

3511
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:51,640
保释金是一千万
Bail is set at $10 million.

3512
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,450
唐尼叔叔来咯
Uncle Donnie's here!

3513
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:11,490
洛奇  过得还好吧
Rocky. How you doing?

3514
02:32:12,790 --> 02:32:14,450
我恨死那只狗了
I hate that fucking dog.

3515
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:16,870
是啊  老了  变得毫无节制
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3516
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:18,460
又开始在家里随地大小便了
Starting to shit in the house again.

3517
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:20,250
-我也是  -抱一个  兄弟
- Me, too. - Come here, buddy.

3518
02:32:21,710 --> 02:32:23,340
-很高兴见到你  兄弟  -我也是
- It's good to see you, pal. - Yeah, you, too.

3519
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:27,220
很高兴见到你  坐吧
Good to see you. Sit down. Oh, man.

3520
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:30,390
过得怎样  兄弟
How you doing, brother?

3521
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:32,720
你懂的
You know.

3522
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,470
糟透了  兄弟
Shitty, pal.

3523
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,680
但还是能撑住的
But I'm hanging in there.

3524
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,520
看看我的新脚链
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3525
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,980
不能踏出家里半步
Can't leave the house, you know?

3526
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:45,650
都快得幽居病了
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3527
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,780
该死的鲁格拉特
Fucking Rugrat.

3528
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,660
那带假发的死基佬
That wig-wearing faggot.

3529
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:51,870
就不该相信那混球  真想杀了他
I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.

3530
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:54,540
对天发誓  我真想掐死他
Swear to God, I want to choke him to death.

3531
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:56,910
不负责任的贱货
Irresponsible little prick.

3532
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,080
我要告诉你一件事
I'll tell you one thing.

3533
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,960
不管是谁的生日
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3534
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,000
我都不去红花餐馆吃饭了
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3535
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:08,970
内奥米在哪  她还好吧
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3536
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,050
在哪边
That's her in the house there.

3537
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,100
你跟她打招呼  估计她也不会理你
You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back.

3538
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:14,970
亲爱的内奥米
Naomi, sweetheart!

3539
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:19,690
她怎么了
What's up her ass?

3540
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,310
-她在生我的气吗  -不  你懂的
- Is she mad at me? - No, you know...

3541
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,860
为了交保释金
We probably have to mortgage the house

3542
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,730
我们应该要把房子抵押了
in order to make bail.

3543
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:26,270
或许还要卖些东西
Probably end up selling the

3544
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:28,530
才能给律师们发工资
thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3545
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:31,070
说实话  这真是一场噩梦  兄弟
It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth.

3546
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:33,030
要不然能怎么办呢  对吧
What are you gonna do, right?

3547
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,660
斯特拉顿才是重点  情况如何
Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important.

3548
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,830
士气如何
How's morale?

3549
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:40,540
现在要合法挣钱  他们都气坏了吧
They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?

3550
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,080
乔丹
Jordan.

3551
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:44,880
我把创始人都找来了
I got the founding partners together.

3552
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,380
跟他们说明了情况
I talked to them about everything.

3553
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:49,130
有我在呢
And I got you.

3554
02:33:49,970 --> 02:33:51,550
有你在是什么意思
What do you mean, you got me?

3555
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:55,470
房子和钱的事都别担心  有我在
The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you.

3556
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:03,600
-好了  -我爱你  兄弟
- All right. - I love you, buddy.

3557
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:05,610
-我也会为你这样做的  -我知道
- You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know.

3558
02:34:05,690 --> 02:34:07,650
-你知道的  对吧  -我知道
- You know that, right? - I know.

3559
02:34:08,650 --> 02:34:09,780
真想亲遍你全身
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3560
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:11,030
好了  够了  够了
All right, enough, enough.

3561
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,240
想喝啤酒吗  兄弟
You want a beer, pal?

3562
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:15,570
你在喝什么
What are you drinking?

3563
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:17,740
不含酒精的东西
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3564
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:19,040
那是什么
What's that?

3565
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:22,120
不含酒精的啤酒
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3566
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:24,500
-是啤酒吗  -是的  不含酒精
- It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol.

3567
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,290
如果你喝多了
But if you drink enough,

3568
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:28,300
如果你喝很多的话  还是会醉吗
if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?

3569
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:30,460
不会的  不含酒精  这才是重点
No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point.

3570
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,590
我不是科学家
I'm not a scientist.

3571
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:32,840
不知道你在说什么
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

3572
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:34,510
你想喝啤酒的话  我可以给你拿
I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.

3573
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,760
我知道  但是我不喝酒了  记得吗
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3574
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:38,060
我已经戒酒了
I don't drink anymore.

3575
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,600
你想进屋里吸点发酵粉吗
Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?

3576
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:41,850
或者是苏打粉
Or baking soda.

3577
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,940
无法想象再也不能嗑嗨的日子啊
Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.

3578
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:46,440
-是啊  -我爱死那些日子了
- Yeah. - I love it.

3579
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:48,070
戒酒的日子怎样
How's being sober?

3580
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:49,980
-糟糕透了  -很无聊  对吧
- Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?

3581
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:52,490
无聊到我想自杀了
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3582
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:55,570
有个词  我们不太想用
There's a term, and we don't like to use it

3583
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:57,120
除非在特殊情况下
unless circumstances dictate,

3584
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,160
我认为这个案子够特殊的了
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3585
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,660
那个词就是  格林纳达
and the term is "Grenada."

3586
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,290
你听说过格林纳达吗
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3587
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:03,410
没听过
No. No, I haven't.

3588
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:07,040
格林纳达是个很有趣的小岛国
Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation

3589
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:10,670
1983年的时候被美国侵略
that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.

3590
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,840
大约有九万人
It's about 90,000 people.

3591
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:15,180
换句话说
And essentially, it means

3592
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:17,930
这个案子我们不可能输
this case is unloseable.

3593
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:19,100
懂吗
Okay?

3594
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:20,040
也就是说
So, you know,

3595
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:22,680
就算我们光着裤子走上法庭
we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.

3596
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:23,930
也没有人会在乎
Nobody gives a fuck.

3597
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:25,560
我赢定了
I'm gonna win.

3598
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:27,100
而你呢
You, sir,

3599
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:32,610
就是格林纳达
are what's known as a Grenada.

3600
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:38,070
你就等着判刑吧
You're looking at real prison time.

3601
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:41,580
洗钱至少要吃20年牢饭
Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.

3602
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:45,250
如果不是抓到你往海外塞钱
And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you

3603
02:35:45,330 --> 02:35:47,000
这案子也不会那么简单
shoving cash in your mattress.

3604
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,130
真的吗
Is that right?

3605
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,420
乔丹
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3606
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:55,970
你要在牢里等死  直到孩子大学毕业
Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,

3607
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,680
那并不是我们的目的
that's not our ambition here.

3608
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,640
还有其他人参与洗钱的勾当
There's other people involved in this, too.

3609
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,850
我们认为他们也应该被送上法庭
We think they need to see their day in court as well.

3610
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:09,480
我怎么觉得你们是要提条件呢
Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?

3611
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:12,230
你看他多聪明  你是心灵感应大师吗
Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?

3612
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,190
全面配合  也就是过去七年间
Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list

3613
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,660
所有同谋的详细名单提供给我们
of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,

3614
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,700
还要同意带窃听器
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3615
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:22,030
等会
Wait...

3616
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,870
你刚才说让我"带窃听器"吗
did you just say "wear a wire"?

3617
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,200
窃听器
A wire.

3618
02:36:25,290 --> 02:36:26,660
什么意思
What does that mean?

3619
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:28,580
你想让我告密  是吗
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3620
02:36:28,670 --> 02:36:29,960
不  我想让你合作
No, I want you to cooperate.

3621
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,960
不  你就是想让我告密
No. You want me to rat, right?

3622
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,960
没错  就是让你告密
Yes. We want you to rat.

3623
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,880
我们还就他妈的想让你干这件事  告密
That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.

3624
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:41,800
克里斯蒂的派对怎么样
How was Cristy's party?

3625
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:42,970
不错
Fine.

3626
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,430
那就好
Good.

3627
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:48,060
宝贝  我今天又去见过律师了
Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today.

3628
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,810
我有非常非常好的消息要告诉你
I have some really, really great news.

3629
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,190
看来这件事完全不会涉及到你  亲爱的
Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey.

3630
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:57,820
这我早就知道
I know that already.

3631
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:59,400
没错  也是
Right. Exactly.

3632
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:02,700
你本来也就没做过什么错事  对吧
You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?

3633
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,870
闹了半天  联邦调查局
It turns out, all the FBI really

3634
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:10,210
真正想让我做的就是跟他们合作
wants from me is to cooperate.

3635
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:11,670
你知道吗
You know?

3636
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:12,710
因为我手上掌握了很多
Turns out I have so much

3637
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:14,750
关于股票市场和华尔街的内幕
information about the stock market and Wall Street,

3638
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:16,630
我可以给政府省好几年的心
I could save the government years of heartache,

3639
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:19,340
更别提数以百万的经济损失了
not to mention countless dollars.

3640
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:23,180
但是更好的还在后头呢  宝贝
But it gets even better, babe.

3641
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,180
如果我决定跟他们合作的话
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3642
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:29,390
我只能只需要蹲个短短四年就行了
I might only be looking at four short years,

3643
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:30,940
这样一来
in which case, you know,

3644
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:34,060
我们可以重新来过  也许把房子卖了
we could start fresh, maybe sell the house.

3645
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:35,770
我要交的任何罚款
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3646
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,650
也是等到我刑满出狱后才用交
wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,

3647
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,030
所以我们还会剩下很多钱
so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?

3648
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,120
当然了  唯一让我有点不爽的就是
The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit

3649
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,830
他们想让我
is this whole idea of

3650
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:50,250
提供关于我朋友的信息
having to give information about my friends.

3651
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:53,540
你不是说过"华尔街上无朋友"吗
Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street." Right?

3652
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:55,590
是的  是的  没错
Right. Right. Exactly.

3653
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:57,250
这件事也有好的一面  亲爱的
There's a silver lining to that, too, honey.

3654
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:59,010
因为他们说最终
Because they said eventually...

3655
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,020
最终所有人
